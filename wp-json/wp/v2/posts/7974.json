This communication was not provided directly to the District by SAFE or its counsel.\u00a0 This and subsequent communications outlined complaints allegedly made over approximately 35 years against a small number of coaches who have worked in the District\u2019s athletic program in a limited number of sports. The SAFE communications criticized the District for a \u201clack of response\u201d with respect to these complaints and alleged \u201ca history of abusive coaching at Saratoga High School that has been allowed and ignored.\u201d <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-20,&quot;335559737&quot;:-20,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Board of Education took immediate action and on October 24, 2023, engaged the law firm Harris Beach PLLC to conduct a thorough, independent investigation of the allegations contained in those communications. The Board charged the firm with: (1) identifying the allegations made, (2) determining if the District was aware of the allegations and (3) if so, determining what the District did to investigate and\/or respond to the allegations. The firm advised the District that it would take the time required to conduct a thoughtful, thorough, and first-rate examination.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-20,&quot;335559737&quot;:-20,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Throughout the investigation, the District provided thousands of pages of records and fully cooperated with the investigators, including arranging for interviews of current and past employees of the District familiar with the allegations recited by SAFE. The investigation, which spanned several months, was thorough and complete. The District asked its employees to cooperate fully with the investigation. We thank them for doing so. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-20,&quot;335559737&quot;:-20,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-20,&quot;335559737&quot;:-20,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Harris Beach has now concluded its independent review and submitted a final report to the District. We are sharing that report with the community. The report has been redacted only to protect the privacy of some of the individuals interviewed and to remove, pursuant to legal requirements, any personnel-specific consequences that may have resulted from any specific situation.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-20,&quot;335559737&quot;:-20,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In response to the allegations made between 2015 and 2022 against coaches in four of the five sports reviewed, the investigation found that the District \u201ctimely and appropriately responded\u201d to the complaints of which it was aware, and that in some cases, the District took remedial action against coaches up to and including discontinuance of the coaching appointment where warranted. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-20,&quot;335559737&quot;:-20,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With respect to a fifth sport \u2013 cross country and track and field \u2013 the investigative report concluded that most, but not all, complaints made between 1989 and the mid-2010s were investigated, and the District took multiple actions regarding the coaches in this sport including counseling and formal discipline. In a few instances, the report determined that there was insufficient follow-through and oversight of the recommended corrective actions.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-20,&quot;335559737&quot;:-20,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In every aspect of our daily responsibility to educate young people, we strive for the highest standards. Our students\u2019 health, safety and welfare are \u2013 and always have been \u2013 the paramount interest and primary focus of the District and its administrators and board members past and present. The failure to sufficiently and comprehensively investigate and respond to some of the complaints made over the 35-year period reviewed was contrary to the District\u2019s best intentions.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-20,&quot;335559737&quot;:-20,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Educating and attending to the wellbeing of our students and student athletes is an awesome responsibility and one that depends upon trust. It is important to everyone involved in our athletic program that our community has confidence in the program\u2019s integrity and excellence.\u00a0We owe this not only to our students and parents, but also to our coaches, the overwhelming majority of whom give generously of themselves and care deeply about their athletes\u2019 wellbeing. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-20,&quot;335559737&quot;:-20,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The District is proud to have thousands of students participating in more than 100 sports annually. The few founded complaints raised in the SAFE documents appear to be exceptions, not the rule. Indeed, during the months in which this investigation was conducted, the District received a large volume of correspondence from past and present student-athletes and their parents praising our athletic program, including the efforts of coaches who were the subject of some of the complaints investigated.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:-20,&quot;335559737&quot;:-20,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">We are determined to use the results of this investigation and the report\u2019s findings to make our strong athletic program even better.
