The event will benefit the HSA, the parent teacher association that plans extra cultural and educational enrichment programs. The Dragonfire 5K will also help the Greenfield Food Pantry, as participants are asked to bring food donations.<\/p>\n<p>Hausam, along with Second Grade Teachers Pam Cooper and Kerri Guthrie, decided to team up and bring this event back because post-COVID, many of the events that once made the school community thrive are inadvertently still on hold. \u201cMany of our parents are new and were not around when events like this took place,\u201d Hausam said. We can\u2019t wait to show them and grow the interest and enthusiasm for bringing more family events back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the past, the challenging, hilly course attracted approximately 100 participants each year.
