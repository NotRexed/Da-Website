The budget represents a 1.87% year-to-year increase and a tax levy change of 2.90%, which is below the local tax cap of 2.92%.<\/p>\n<p>The 2022-2023 proposed budget maintains student programming and extracurricular activities, while investing in key program areas within our schools. The budget includes the addition of six teaching assistants to expand Integrated Co-Teaching in second and third grade at all elementary schools, a teacher on special assignment to support the Committee on Special Education, and funding to offer a girls varsity ice hockey team through a merger agreement with other area school districts.<\/p>\n<p>Each year, the budget is balanced through a combination of state aid, property taxes, and fund balance. Similar to other school districts, SSCSD continues to be challenged by rising costs. As a result, the district must spend more to sustain the programs currently in place and continue to meet the needs of all students. Through operational efficiencies and staff reallocation, the spending plan includes nearly $1.26 million in savings.<\/p>\n<h2>Also on the Ballot<\/h2>\n<p>Bus Bond Proposition: This would authorize the school district to spend an estimated $1,139,000 to purchase seven 66-passenger school buses and three 30-passenger buses. State aid would reimburse the district for approximately 40 percent of the cost. These purchases are part of the district\u2019s plan to replace buses near the end of their useful lives to reduce maintenance costs and help ensure a safe fleet of vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>Facilities Bond Proposition: This would authorize the school district to spend $460,000 to purchase two heavy-duty front loaders. The district currently rents this equipment annually for snow removal. The district estimates a cost savings of $669,500 over the 25-year useful life of the equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Board of Education Election: District residents will elect three individuals to the Board of Education for three-year terms. The candidates, in the order they will appear on the ballot, are Natalya Lakhtakia, Dean Kolligian, John Brueggemann, Edwin Spickler, Martha Devaney, and Billie McCann.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Voter Information<\/h2>\n<p>Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. at Caroline Street, Division Street, Lake Avenue, Geyser Road, Dorothy Nolan, and Greenfield elementary schools.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Voter Registration<\/h2>\n<p>Voter registration is required in the Saratoga Springs City School District. Anyone who is registered to vote in general elections and has voted within the past four years may vote in school district elections. District residents may also register at the Saratoga County Board of Elections Office in Ballston Spa from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Those who prefer to register by mail may pick up voter registration forms at post offices, public libraries, state government offices or the MacFadden Administration Building at 3 Blue Streak Boulevard in Saratoga Springs. Completed forms should be mailed to the Board of Elections. To register, residents must be United States citizens, at least 18 years old, and have resided in the school district for at least 30 days prior to the vote.<\/p>\n<h2>Absentee Ballots<\/h2>\n<p>Residents who will be out of town or unable to vote in person can vote by absentee ballot. You must complete an application to receive an absentee ballot.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Tuesday, May 17, Saratoga Springs City School District residents will vote on the $137,138,255 budget proposal for the 2022-2023 school year.
