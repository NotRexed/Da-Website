The proposed budget prioritizes the safety and social-emotional needs of our students while enhancing the educational programs and services offered in our district.<\/p>\n<h2>2023-2024 Proposed Budget Overview<\/h2>\n<p>We believe that investing in our students is crucial to their success, and this budget reflects our commitment to providing a high-quality education to all students in our district. We also want to highlight that the proposed budget represents a tax levy change of 2.75%, which is below the local tax cap of 2.77%.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Safety and well-being:<\/strong> Our school district strives to create a learning environment where our students and staff feel safe and supported. The proposed budget includes the addition of two school resource officers, who were added during the past school year, to support our six elementary school buildings and an additional school counselor at the middle school.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Academic Program Enhancements<\/strong>: The budget preserves the robust academic programming already offered within our district and allocates additional funding to expand career and technical education opportunities for students through WSWHE BOCES. Additionally, a 0.6 English language learner teacher and one elementary teacher will be added to support our students.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Access to Technology:<\/strong> The district is committed to enhancing our learning environments by providing students with access to technology within our elementary classrooms. The budget will fund new technology hardware in elementary classrooms to replace aging devices as part of a technology replacement cycle.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/nY6ozqCX5TY\">Watch the 2023-2024 Recorded Budget Presentation.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Also on the Ballot:<\/h2>\n<p><strong> Bus Bond Proposition:<\/strong> This would authorize the school district to spend an estimated $1,525,000 to purchase six 66-passenger school buses, four 30-passenger buses, and one 25-passenger bus with a wheelchair lift. State aid would reimburse the district for approximately 40 percent of the cost. These purchases are part of the district\u2019s plan to replace buses near the end of their useful lives to reduce maintenance costs and help ensure a safe fleet of vehicles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Board of Education Election:<\/strong> District residents will elect three individuals to the Board of Education for three-year terms. <span>The candidates, in order that they will appear on the ballot, are Anjeanette Emeka,\u00a0 Sharon Dominguez, Joseph Sabanos, Tony Krackeler, and\u00a0 Beth Fogarty Braxton.\u00a0<\/span>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TpH70wRMvSE\">Click here to watch a recording of the Meet the Candidates Forum.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vote411.org\/\">Visit vote411.org to read candidate bios<\/a>.\u00a0 Search your address, click on &#8220;Saratoga Springs Board of Education, &#8220;and click on each candidate.<\/p>\n<h2>Polling Locations<\/h2>\n<p>Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. at Caroline Street, Division Street, Lake Avenue, Geyser Road, Dorothy Nolan, and Greenfield elementary schools.
