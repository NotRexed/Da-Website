The task force\u2019s goal was to balance class sizes across all six elementary schools, optimize the use of existing resources\u2014including staffing, space, and transportation\u2014and reduce or eliminate the need for administrative transfers.<\/p>\n<p>After several months of collaboration, the task force recommended the introduction of elementary flex zones, which were initially planned for implementation in September 2020. While the COVID-19 pandemic briefly delayed the rollout, flex zones have been in place for the past several years, allowing for more balanced class sizes and enabling smaller class size targets across the district.<\/p>\n<p>Now, five years after the BOE approved the use of flex zones, we are reconvening the task force to assess their effectiveness and identify opportunities for improvement. In addition to re-engaging original task force members, we welcome feedback from other staff members and family members who may not have been part of the initial discussions but are interested in learning more and contributing to this review.<\/p>\n<p>To facilitate this process, we have scheduled three evening meetings this spring.\u00a0 Meetings will be held at the MacFadden Administration Building from 6-7 p.m. Any school community member is invited to attend.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tuesday, April 1<\/li>\n<li>Tuesday, April 22<\/li>\n<li>Tuesday, May 6<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the fall of 2019, the District convened a task force of 33 staff members, administrators, Board of Education (BOE) Trustees, and community members to explore ways to enhance our learning environments.
