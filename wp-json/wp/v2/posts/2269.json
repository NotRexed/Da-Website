Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and all members of the Uvalde community. This horrific event that took the lives of 19 children and two adults, is not only heartbreaking, but unconscionable. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As we learn more details about this tragic event in the hours and days ahead, it will be important for us\u00a0to spend time talking with our children and help them cope with this news. Below is a list of recommendations for parents and guardians from the National Association of School Psychologists about what we can do to support our children during a time like this.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0Reassure children that they are safe.\u00a0Emphasize that schools are very safe. Validate their feelings. Explain that all feelings are okay when a tragedy occurs. Let children talk about their feelings, help put them into perspective, and assist them in expressing these feelings appropriately. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0Make time to talk.\u00a0Let their questions be your guide as to how much information to provide. Be patient. Children and youth do not always talk about their feelings readily. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0Keep your explanations developmentally appropriate. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Early elementary school children need brief, simple information that should be balanced with reassurances that their school and homes are safe and that adults are there to protect them. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\nUpper elementary and early middle school children will be more vocal in asking questions about whether they truly are safe and what is being done at their school. They may need assistance separating reality from fantasy. Discuss efforts of school and community leaders to provide safe schools. \u00a0<br \/>\nUpper middle school and high school students will have strong and varying opinions about the causes of violence in schools and society. They will share concrete suggestions about how to make school safer and how to prevent tragedies in society. Emphasize the role that students have in maintaining safe schools by following school safety guidelines communicating any personal safety concerns to school administrators and accessing support for emotional needs. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>4.\u00a0Review safety procedures.\u00a0This should include procedures and safeguards at school and at home. Help children identify at least one adult at school and in the community to whom they go if they feel threatened or at risk. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>5.\u00a0Observe children\u2019s emotional state. Some children may not express their concerns verbally. Changes in behavior, appetite, and sleep patterns can indicate a child\u2019s level of anxiety or discomfort. In most children, these symptoms will ease with reassurance and time. However, some children may be at risk for more intense reactions. Children who have had a past traumatic experience or personal loss, suffer from depression or other mental illness, or with special needs may be at greater risk for severe reactions than others. Seek the help of a mental health professional if you are at all concerned. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>6.\u00a0Limit television viewing of these events.\u00a0Limit television viewing and be aware if the television is on in common areas. Developmentally inappropriate information can cause anxiety or confusion, particularly in young children. Adults also need to be mindful of the content of conversations that they have with each other in front of children, even teenagers, and limit their exposure to vengeful, hateful, and angry comments that might be misunderstood. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>7.\u00a0Maintain a normal routine.\u00a0Keeping\u00a0a regular schedule can be reassuring and promote physical health. Ensure that children get plenty of sleep, regular meals, and exercise. Encourage them to keep up with their schoolwork and extracurricular activities but don\u2019t push them if they seem overwhelmed.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I\u00a0want to assure you that the safety of our students and staff is our top priority, and our school district has a comprehensive safety plan to help avoid tragedies like this. \u00a0As a school district, we are always looking for ways that we can improve and create a safe and welcoming environment for our students, staff, and families. Our safety plan is reviewed, practiced, and updated regularly with input and feedback from local law enforcement. We meet with law enforcement on a regular basis to review safety practices and revise our crisis intervention plans for each school building. Additionally, our schools routinely practice lockdown drills that are supervised by our School Resource Officers.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We want to remind you that all members of our school community have access to our Safe Schools Helpline which is available 24\/7. To report a situation, call (800) 418-6423 or 1-800-4-1-VOICE (ext. 359), text TIPS to 614-426-0240 (Please note that this number was updated on August 1, 2021), or complete an online report:\u00a0www.safeschoolhelpline.com.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As a community, we need to continue to work together and ensure the safety and wellness of our students. If you or your child is struggling and needs any type of support, please call your child\u2019s school. We are here to help you and support our children in any way that we can. Our school counselors and social workers will be available to assist our students and staff. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Please do not hesitate to contact your school if you have any questions or concerns.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Sincerely,\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Michael Patton\u00a0<br \/>\nSuperintendent of Schools\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Parents, Guardians, and Saratoga Springs Community Members,\u00a0 We are all deeply saddened by the senseless tragedy of another school shooting yesterday in Uvalde,\u00a0Texas.
