The distinguished alumni named to the Hall of Distinction represent an extraordinary range of personal and professional achievements.\u00a0 Their accomplishments serve as an inspiration for our current students in their motivation to attain their aspirations.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>Harvey R Fox<\/h3>\n<p>Harvey R Fox graduated from Saratoga Springs High School in 1971.\u00a0 Born in Saratoga Hospital, he is a lifelong resident who takes pride in the fact that, wherever he travels in the US and abroad, people he meets always know about his small Upstate NY city and its special charm.<\/p>\n<p><span>Harvey graduated from Eisenhower College in Seneca Falls, NY with a liberal arts degree. After traveling to Peru and throughout the Western US, he returned to Saratoga Springs. His parents, Norman and Eva Fox, owned N. Fox, a very popular general merchandise business on Broadway. Many native Saratogians, as well as generations of Skidmore students, have fond memories of shopping there. In 1977, his father presented Harvey with the idea of buying the business. One year later, Harvey finalized the purchase, and his father retired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Harvey was 25 years old and the greatest adventure of his life was just beginning. In 1981, he married Cassie, a recent Skidmore graduate and together they began building their business to the success it is today as well as raising their family, son Jevan, also a proud graduate of Saratoga Springs High School 2002 and Taryn, the light of their lives. They also began to get involved in philanthropy as well as civic participation.<\/p>\n<p>Harvey\u2019s contributions over 42 years include leadership positions on the Zoning Board of Appeals, the Saratoga YMCA, the Special Assessment District, and the Downtown Business Association as well as Charter Revision, Wayfinding and Parking Task forces. He is a major contributor to The Wesley Foundation, Skidmore College, Saratoga Hospital as well as many of the local organizations that can immediately see the impact of his donations such as Act With Respect Always, Sponsor a Scholar and Franklin Community Center.<\/p>\n<p><span>Harvey is proud to accept the Hall of Distinction Award and expresses gratitude to Cassie and Jevan for being the support system that allowed him to soar. He also acknowledges all the people who mentored him throughout his journey. Being open to learning from others is one of the building blocks of success.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Heidi Owen West<\/h3>\n<p>Heidi Owen West graduated from Saratoga Springs High School in 1984. Upon graduation, Heidi moved to New York City to begin her studies at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT). After honing her craft working alongside designers and fashion industry giants, Heidi returned to the Capitol Region to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in English with a minor in Fine Arts.<\/p>\n<p><span>Heidi\u2019s love of serving others in her community was born in her hometown of Saratoga Springs. Some of Heidi\u2019s earliest memories include volunteering with her family downtown and planting trees with the Jaycees. Her first job was working concessions at SPAC. The hours spent volunteering and working during her youth instilled in her a deep sense of customer and community service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In 1991, Heidi partnered with her mother, Kay Owen, to open a series of successful downtown businesses including Indulgence Caf\u00e9, which sold baked goods made by Joan Tallman of the Bread Basket; Nostalgia, where one could find the most unique gifts and fine furnishings; The Bunny Patch, offering heirloom-quality children\u2019s apparel; and the well-known women\u2019s fashion boutique, Lifestyles of Saratoga, which remains a downtown staple today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In 2016, Heidi launched Caroline &amp; Main, a women\u2019s clothing store focused on sustainable fashion with a whimsical flair. After opening Caroline &amp; Main, Heidi turned her efforts toward designing a different type of retail experience. In 2019, she launched Union Hall Supply Co. a cozy, local outfitter where one can shop for casual, well-made clothing and accessories designed for men.<\/p>\n<p>Heidi\u2019s current establishments, Lifestyles, Caroline &amp; Main and Union Hall Supply Co, provide distinctly different shopping experiences, and are favored by both locals and the city\u2019s many visitors.<\/p>\n<p><span>Giving back to the people of the city that helped shape her journey has been foundational to her life. She is constantly looking for ways to expand her reach and broaden her impact. Nearly 10 years ago, Heidi created a new business model to allow her to give financially in a more profound way. She has also built initiatives into her businesses, such as the Give Back Gift Wrap Bar and The Lifestyles Knit Project, which raises funds for a different organization each year. Heidi is a proud supporter of numerous charitable organizations including Shelters of Saratoga, RISE, Wellspring, B.E.S.T., Aim Services, Franklin Community Center, Yaddo, and Floyd Warriors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Heidi believes that small businesses are the heart of a community. It is this deeply held belief that drives her to also give back to the small business community. Heidi currently serves as the Vice President of Saratoga\u2019s Downtown Business Association and as a Board Member for Saratoga County Capital Resource Corporation (SCCRC). She is also a SCORE mentor through the U.S. Small Business Association, helping to provide guidance and support to other like-minded entrepreneurs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>She has previously held roles with SPAC Action Council, Gateway House of Peace, Saratoga Rowing Association and Double H Ranch. In 2022, Heidi was awarded the Saratoga County Woman of Influence award for her dedication and service to the community.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Saratoga Springs High School Hall of Distinction will honor two outstanding individuals for their extraordinary professional accomplishments at the 2024 Hall of Distinction Recognition Ceremony on Tuesday, June 4, 2024.\u00a0 The 2024 Annual Hall of Distinction inductees are Heidi Owen West and Harvey Fox.\u00a0The Hall of Distinction was established to recognize and celebrate the &hellip;
