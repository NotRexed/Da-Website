We are supposed to be hearing about if school will reopen after May 15 this week from Governor Cuomo. Rest assured that we will be providing you with updates about our discussions depending on when we might return to school. Stay tuned to your emails!<\/p>\n<p>Keep up the great work that you are doing in your learning!
