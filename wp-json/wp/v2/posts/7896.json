However, the existing BOCES aid formula for CTE programs operated by BOCES only allows districts to receive aid on the first $30,000 of a BOCES instructor\u2019s salary. The average salary of a CTE teacher is now at least $65,000 and the aidable portion should be increased to ensure that districts can adequately support these programs. WSWHE requests that the BOCES aid reimbursement for BOCES CTE teacher\u2019s salary be increased to $60,000.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"CRACKING THE CODE: How Changing the BOCES Aid Formula Can Impact Workforce Development\" width=\"525\" height=\"295\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Ig5uVgPqxA8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"workforce\"><a id=\"workforce\"><\/a>Workforce Development<\/h3>\n<p>School districts are facing extreme workforce challenges. Teachers, bus drivers, and other staff shortages are making it increasingly difficult to fully and properly staff buildings. Compounding the issues caused by the lack of candidates in the pipeline, current professionals are increasingly choosing to leave their roles earlier in their careers. To address the growing problems of recruitment and retention, the state should consider policy changes and programs that would attract people to needed roles and incentivize employees to stay. Increased flexibility for teacher certifications adopted in the last year has helped districts to more effectively utilize those teachers that they are able to hire but continued adjustments and increased reciprocity with other states are needed. The restrictive benefit structure and older retirement age for Tier 6 of the retirement system have diminished the effectiveness of a once attractive recruitment and retention tool that could be restored with adjustments to the benefit structure. In the short term, once again extending the ability of retirees to work in school districts without pension penalty or a 211 waiver would allow districts to continue to use willing retirees to fill gaps while the employee pipeline is strengthened.<br \/>\nWe request that policymakers increase flexibilities in teacher certification, retiree employment and Tier 6 reform.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"capital-projects\"><a id=\"capitalprojects\"><\/a>Ongoing Capital Projects<\/h3>\n<p>Current law allows school districts to make one \u201ccapital outlay\u201d annually. Under this provision, each district may conduct one project that has a cost of $100,000 or less and is paid for in cash each year. Districts then receive their total building aid on the full project in the next year. Because these projects do not require voter approval or borrowing, they can be completed more efficiently and save both the state and the district money, because of the lack of interest. The current project threshold of $100,000 was established in 2002 and has not increased since. In the two decades that have passed, the relative buying power of $100,000 has decreased significantly. That was true before COVID-19, but in the last three years, prices for materials and labor have increased exponentially. We request that the spending limit for capital outlays be raised to $250,000 annually beginning in the 2024-25 school year.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"school-aid\"><a id=\"stateaid\"><\/a>2024-2025 School Aid<\/h3>\n<p>Districts around the state, including those in the WSWHE BOCES region are appreciative of the State\u2019s efforts to fully fund the Foundation Aid formula and expense based aids. To ensure that all students are supported, we ask that the following provisions be included in the next state budget:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A due minimum increase for all districts, regardless of Foundation Aid phase-in level.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0A \u201csave-harmless\u201d provision to ensure a stable funding baseline for all districts.<\/li>\n<li>Support an initial evaluation of the current cost to educate a successful student.\n<p>We request that these provisions be included in the 2024-25 State Budget.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buses\"><a id=\"bus\"><\/a>Zero-Emission Buses<\/h3>\n<p>School districts around the state recognize the importance of taking steps to reduce emissions and protect the environment for the students of the future. Current state law requires that all new school buses acquired be zero emissions by 2027 and all buses in operation must be zero emissions by 2035. The first state guidance on the transition was not released until almost a year and a half after the law was enacted \u2013 and districts are already running into barriers. The supply of buses for the districts that have the funding and infrastructure in place to begin operations are not adequate or timely. Existing systems and supports have not been updated to reflect this change. Districts need to be able to avail themselves of the full range of state resources and supports through existing aid streams and programs. We request that the State evaluate all existing programs around transportation, capital and planning and make updates to all planning and funding streams to include costs related to planning and executing this transition.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Component school districts in the\u00a0WSWHE BOCES, including Saratoga Springs City School District, have established a set of regional advocacy priorities for the legislative session.\u00a0 Career and Technical Education\u00a0|\u00a0Workforce Development\u00a0|\u00a0Ongoing Capital Projects\u00a0|\u00a02024-2025 School Aid\u00a0|\u00a0Zero-Emission Buses\u00a0 We encourage our school community to advocate for these priorities by reaching out to local elected representatives.\u00a0 Click here to search &hellip;
