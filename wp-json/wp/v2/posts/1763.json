We recognize that we cannot truly replicate the instruction that happens in our classrooms in an online format, especially because we know that there are students who do not have access to the technology this requires.<\/p>\n<p>The adjustment to remote learning has been challenging for everyone. Our district responded quickly in making sure all of our students have access to technology at home and instructional resources to help families adjust to remote instruction. Knowing that this is a completely new environment for teaching and learning; we have been intentional in moving ahead with a thoughtful approach to not overwhelm our students and families.<\/p>\n<p>We know there are many questions from parents and students. The District has created a <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/x7zgq_qDKv4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Remote Instruction &amp; Grading Video\">Remote Instruction &amp; Grading Video<\/a> to provide a detailed explanation of the District&#8217;s Continuity of Learning Plan and how grading will be done during this time of remote learning.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, a presentation to provide clarity about reasonable expectations for students, families, and teachers was shared with families on April 3. In the presentation you will find guidelines related to curriculum, instruction, and time spent by students learning during the suspension of onsite classes.<\/p>\n<p>We encourage you to the extent possible to maintain a schedule and routine with your child. You should also consider varying the amount of time using technology and media and avoid excessive exposure to media coverage. We are committed to doing everything we can to support our students and families and appreciate your ongoing support and partnership. Please continue to use the resources that your student&#8217;s teachers have communicated to you. For instructional questions, we encourage you to first reach out to your child&#8217;s teacher(s).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Throughout this extended school closure, our goal is to ensure students continue learning, and that our students continue to feel as cared about and connected to school as possible during this time.
