However, sensory and mindfulness tools were not available to all students in every classroom. Some students had these tools from home, but some did not. The Division Street Building Leadership Team not only wanted to increase equity in access for each student, but also wanted to normalize the need to use these tools to help regulate emotions and improve focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of the BLT was to create a collection of regulation and mindfulness tools for each classroom in the building. The group compiled a list of tools our students would benefit from, based on feedback from students, families, and staff. They also incorporated the breathing ball that Jilly, the students\u2019 yoga instructor (funded by the Arts in Education Program), introduced to students. They use it to help regulate their breathing and create calm in their bodies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BLT then worked with the Division Street PTA to create a Donation Day o<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">n Giving Tuesday where families and staff could purchase items on a wish list. The school community was incredibly generous in their support! In addition to the breathing ball, the bins include weighted lap blankets, stress balls, noise-canceling headphones, pop-its, liquid timers, Theraputty, and chimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the bins were put together, members of the BLT presented them to the faculty. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">They explained how each tool could be used to promote self-regulation and improve attention and brainstormed with teachers about the best way to roll out the bins to their students. Bins and sensory tools were also created for the AIS teachers,\u00a0 Special Education teachers, and special area teachers to ensure that students had the tools they needed no matter where they were in the school!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feedback from staff and students has been very positive. Teachers reported that students have been using the bins daily to help calm down when upset, to help stay focused during a lesson, and to help them return to baseline after experiencing anxiety.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the mental health needs of students have continued to increase, the BLT was thrilled to be able to implement this project that helps address these needs, and also helps to normalize the need we all have to regulate our emotions and calm our minds.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year, Division Street teachers noticed an increase in anxiety, and self-regulation needs among students.
