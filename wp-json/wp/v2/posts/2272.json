The Eighth Annual Hall of Distinction inductees are Jennifer Jolly and Matt Jones. \u00a0The Hall of Distinction was established to recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of outstanding graduates of Saratoga Springs High School who have made exceptional contributions and excelled in their chosen fields. The distinguished alumni named to the Hall of Distinction represent an extraordinary range of personal and professional achievements.\u00a0 Their accomplishments serve as an inspiration for our current students in their motivation to attain their aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>At the ceremony, the district will celebrate the recipients from 2020 and 2022. Due to the pandemic, the district was not able to hold the Seventh Annual Hall of Distinction ceremony in 2020. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Wallace W. Allerdice, Jr.<\/h2>\n<p>Wallace W. Allerdice Jr. graduated from Saratoga Springs High School in 1960. A lifelong resident whose family roots go back to Saratoga since 1860, he has never liked straying far from home. He attended Siena College for two years majoring in both engineering and then business administration, failing both times. The following fall of 1962 he attended Hudson Valley Community College graduating with an ASS degree in business administration. He then got a job for NYSDOT in Albany as a clerk. He was soon promoted to a computer programmer, a new and upcoming field. Meanwhile, he started going to night courses at Russell Sage College in business administration receiving a BS degree in business and economics. In 1969 he married the love of his life, Sue. He enjoyed his job at the state for 16 years but always dreamed of making a living in the city he loved.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In 1975 he went to BOCES in Saratoga, took a welding course and began the first of many businesses, a welding shop out of his garage. Having success, he quit the State in 1980. In 1981 he purchased his first apartment house and proceeded to renovate it back to life. Wally always had a fascination for tools, construction, and mechanics. This lifelong obsession with learning served him well.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In November of 1982, he was approached by the Grande Family urging him to buy their failing lumberyard on Division and Walworth. After saying no several times, they gave him a deal he couldn\u2019t refuse. He was extremely lucky to quickly assemble an amazing team and the business took off.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As the years went on, through many great friendships and the help of the Adirondack Trust Company, Wally was able to diversify the business and add a Commercial Door Shop and Glass and Mirror. In 2005 he added a homeowner-oriented hardware store in Milton and as the surrounding area grew in 2009 he expanded again to Malta.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Coming from a family who served the Saratoga Community, it was important for Wally to give back and preserve the history of this area. He was elected to serve on the Saratoga Springs Preservation Foundation, Saratoga Historical Society, a Trustee of both the Walworth and Bolster Collections, and Brookside the Saratoga County History Museum. Looking towards the future and being a part of development in the city, he served 20 years on the Saratoga Springs City Planning Board. In 1996, he was elected to the board of the Adirondack Trust Company.\u00a0 He served 21 years there. Recently he just ended his time on the board of Universal Preservation Hall and is still on the board of Saratoga Automobile Museum.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Wally is very proud to accept the Hall of Distinction Award especially since his wife of 52 years, Sue received the same award in 2018. Both of his sons Wallace W. Allerdice III, and William J. Allerdice graduated from SSHS. Wally is living his dream of making a living in Saratoga Springs and doing what he loves.<\/p>\n<h2>Bill Grande<\/h2>\n<p>Bill was born and raised in Saratoga Springs and was a lifetime resident, his only time living away from his beloved community was from 1955-57 while proudly serving his country in the Corps of Engineers in Sondrestrom, Greenland, overseeing the construction of the airstrip support buildings there.<\/p>\n<p>Bill was an honors graduate of Saratoga Springs High School in 1951 and the School of Architecture at RPI in 1955 where he was president of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He attended the Corps of Engineers Officer Training School in 1954-55. Upon his return from Greenland, Bill became a professional engineer and dedicated much of his life to the improvement of the city he so loved. Along with his father and brother, Bill worked tirelessly to provide affordable housing in and around Saratoga, helping to build several hundred homes for working families, along with hundreds of additions to houses and businesses. Bill was involved in the design and construction of many commercial buildings in the community including projects for the Adirondack Trust Co., Stewarts, Fasig-Tipton, the Saratoga Raceway and numerous professional offices. He was also very involved in the land use planning and infrastructure development that brought these projects to fruition. His progressive approach to development was coupled with his lifelong interest in history and commitment to historic preservation as he oversaw the renovation construction of numerous historic homes and buildings throughout Saratoga County.<\/p>\n<p>Bill was keenly interested in improving the community and he devoted himself to many civic activities. He served on numerous boards including the Saratoga YMCA where he served as president, the Saratoga Springs Planning Board and was a charter member of the Architectural Review and Historic Review Boards as well as a director of the community bank, the Adirondack Trust Co. He worked with the Historic Preservation Foundation, the Saratoga Springs Historical Society, in particular the preservation of the Bolster Collection, and the National Bottle Museum.
