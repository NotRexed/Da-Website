If you live in a flex attendance zone (which may include two or three schools) your child will be assigned to one of these schools in order to balance class sizes across all six elementary buildings. Flex attendance zones allow the District to better utilize existing resources, such as staff, space, transportation, and reduce the need for administrative transfers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Utilize the <a href=\"https:\/\/client.schoolmapsonline.com\/saratogaschools.org\/full.htm?v=0\">District Attendance Zone Map<\/a> to search your address to see which designated or flex attendance zone you are located in.
