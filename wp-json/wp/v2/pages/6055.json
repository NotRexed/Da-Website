FERPA is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of student records. The law gives parents and students over 18 years of age (referred to in the law as \u201celigible students\u201d) the following rights:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The right to inspect and review the student\u2019s education records within 45 days of the day the district receives a request for access. Parents or eligible students should submit to the Building Principal a written request that identifies the records they wish to inspect. The Principal will make arrangements for access and notify the parent or eligible student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.<\/li>\n<li>The right to request the amendment of the student\u2019s education records that the parent or eligible student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Parents or eligible students may ask the district to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading by writing the Principal, clearly identifying the part of the record they want changed and specifying why it is inaccurate or misleading. Please note that the amendment procedure may not be used to challenge a grade, an opinion, or a substantive decision made by the school district about a student. If the district decides not to amend the record as requested by the parent or eligible student, the district will notify the parent or eligible student of the decision and advise them of their right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the parent or eligible student when notified of the right to a hearing.<\/li>\n<li>The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student\u2019s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. There is an exception to FERPA\u2019s prohibition against non-consensual disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, pursuant to which the district may disclose personally identifiable information from education records without consent.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to \u201cschool officials\u201d with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the district as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel); a person serving on the school board; a person or company with whom the district has contracted to perform a special task (such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist); or a parent or student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. With respect to what constitutes a \u2018legitimate education interest\u2019, it is generally accepted that a school official generally has a legitimate education interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill their professional responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>A student\/parent who believes there has been a violation of the provisions of FERPA may file a complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20202-5920. Complaints must contain specific allegations of fact giving reasonable cause to believe that a violation of FERPA has occurred.<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/studentprivacy.ed.gov\/ferpa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"U.S. Department of Education\u2019s website\">More information<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"software\"><\/a>District Software Catalog<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sscsd.district-software.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"District's Software Catalog\">Click here to view the District\u2019s Software Catalog<\/a><span>.\u00a0 The district may only utilize vendors who are compliant with all NY Education Law Section 2-d Part 121 security and privacy requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our district is committed to ensuring student privacy in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations and district policies.\u00a0 Questions about data and security may be directed to the Data Protection Officer (DPO) at sscsd_dpo@saratogaschools.org.
