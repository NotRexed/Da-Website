Students continually build on their skills throughout their school careers, allowing each student to discover their personal pathway to the future.<\/p>\n<h2>K-12 Curriculum<\/h2>\n<p>The district is dedicated to preparing all students for the future by providing educational programming that aligns with the New York State Department of Education Learning Standards. Read more about our K-12 Curriculum in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/academics\/curriculum-guide\/\">Curriculum Overview section<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Universal Pre-Kindergarten<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/about-us\/student-registration\/upk\/\">Universal Pre-Kindergarten program (UPK)<\/a> is a free pre-K program, funded by New York State, for four-year-old children who reside in the district. Classes are currently offered in partnership with the Saratoga Regional YMCA and Saratoga County EOC Head Start.<\/p>\n<h2>Academic Intervention Services<\/h2>\n<p>Academic Intervention Services are designed to help eligible students achieve the NYS learning standards in English language arts and mathematics. These supports may include additional small group, solo, or primary instruction that supplements the general curriculum; and\/or student support services needed to address barriers to improved academic performance.<\/p>\n<p>The district uses a multi-tiered system of supports to help students who are struggling and improve outcomes for all students.<\/p>\n<h2>School Attendance\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our district is excited to welcome our students into our school buildings every day, and we <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">believe that school attendance is an important factor for our students to be successful.\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Because daily school attendance is so crucial in student achievement, and in response to increased accountability measures under The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the District is focusing on improving student attendance at all grade levels.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Understanding Chronic Absenteeism\u00a0<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Each day a student is absent is a lost opportunity for learning. We recognize that many children miss a few days of school each year without long-term consequences. However, when they miss many days, the effects are almost always negative. The New York State Education Department classifies a student as being \u201cchronically absent\u201d when they miss 10 percent of school days, and it is different from truancy, which counts only unexcused absences. Students are considered chronically absent when they miss 18 school days a year for any reason. That works out to less than 2 days per month.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Attendance Notifications<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">As part of our efforts to bring awareness to the issue of chronic absenteeism and the importance of good attendance, our district is mailing letters to families if a child has missed more than ten percent of the school year.\u00a0 <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Parents and guardians may view attendance records for students in grades 6-12 on the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sscsdportal.saratogaschools.org\/schooltoolweb\/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">SchoolTool Portal<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> at any time.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What Can Families Do?<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">We understand that students get sick, family emergencies arise, and other situations occur that make school attendance difficult, and absences are sometimes necessary.
