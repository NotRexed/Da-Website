The Board of Education\u2019s objective is to provide all students with an equal opportunity to grow intellectually, socially, emotionally, and physically. Parents, students and school personnel must work together to ensure the maintenance of the proper atmosphere to achieve this goal.<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>To achieve this goal, all members of the school community and visitors must act responsibly. School personnel will use restorative (mediation, counseling, and education) and\/or punitive (detention, suspension) measures to address violations of the Code of Conduct, as appropriate under the circumstances.\u00a0<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The District has a long-standing set of expectations for conduct on school property and at school functions.\u00a0 These expectations are based on the principles of civility, mutual respect, citizenship, character, tolerance, honesty, and integrity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Board of Education recognizes the need to clearly define these expectations for acceptable conduct on school property, to identify the possible consequences of unacceptable conduct and to ensure that discipline, when necessary, is administered promptly and fairly.\u00a0 To this end, the Board of Education adopts this Code of Conduct.<\/p>\n<p>***New York State School Boards Association (NYSSBA) defines parents <span>as &#8220;parent, guardian or person in parental relation to a student&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Why\"><\/a>II. Why Do We Have a Code of Conduct?\u00a0<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Students need to be supported and engaged in school in order to promote strong character and appropriate conduct. It is also essential that students are able to take age-appropriate responsibility for their own behavior.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Student engagement is developed when students are provided with multiple opportunities to participate in a wide- range of positive social activities while interacting with caring, supportive adults. This helps to ensure that students are better able to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>recognize and manage emotions;<\/li>\n<li>develop caring and concern for others;<\/li>\n<li>establish positive relationships;<\/li>\n<li>make responsible decisions; and<\/li>\n<li>handle challenging situations constructively and ethically.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Effective and engaging instruction and positive behavioral supports are the foundations of a positive school climate. School teachers, administrators, and other staff are encouraged to set high expectations for student success, build positive relationships with students as well as teach and model appropriate behaviors for success. Modeling respectful, positive behavior is especially critical during disciplinary interventions.<\/li>\n<li>All adults, teachers, principals, administrators, school staff, parents, Board of Education, and the larger community have an obligation to help students become good citizens and lead productive lives by modeling desired behaviors and cultivating those behaviors in students.<\/li>\n<li>Appropriate conduct and strong character are reflected in a civil, respectful, healthy and caring environment.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Student discipline and support will be implemented in a manner which is caring, equitable, respectful, based on trust among administration, staff, students, and families while holding all individuals accountablebut aims to be balanced between restorative practices and traditional consequences. This will help students:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>learn from their mistakes;<\/li>\n<li>understand why their behavior was unacceptable;<\/li>\n<li>acknowledge the harm they caused or the negative impact of their actions;<\/li>\n<li>understand what they could have done differently;<\/li>\n<li>take responsibility for their actions;<\/li>\n<li>learn pro-social strategies and skills to use in the future; and<\/li>\n<li>understand that further consequences and\/or interventions will be implemented if their unacceptable behavior persists.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>The District will continuously monitor results in an effort to determine strategies for improvement.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\n<a href=\"#TopPage\">Top of Page<\/a><\/p>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<h2><a id=\"Definitions\"><\/a>III.

(2) sending a student to the Principal\u2019s office for the remainder of the class time only; or (3) sending a student to another building staff member for counseling.\u00a0 Time-honored classroom management techniques such as these do not constitute disciplinary removals for purposes of this code.<\/p>\n<p>On occasion, a student\u2019s behavior may become increasingly disruptive.\u00a0 For purposes of this Code of Conduct, a disruptive student is a student who substantially interferes with the educational process or with the teacher\u2019s authority over the classroom.\u00a0 This occurs when a student demonstrates a persistent \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>unwillingness to comply with the teacher\u2019s instructions or repeatedly violates the teacher\u2019s classroom behavior rules.<\/p>\n<p>A teacher may remove a student from the classroom due to inappropriate behavior, and follow-up with the Principal or designee.\u00a0 Based on the severity of the student\u2019s inappropriate behavior, the Principal or Principal\u2019s designee will determine the length of time the student is removed from class.\u00a0 The Principal or the Principal\u2019s designee may overturn the removal of the student from class if one of the following is found:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The allegations against the student are not supported by substantial evidence.<\/li>\n<li>The student\u2019s removal is otherwise in violation of law, including the District\u2019s Code of Conduct.<\/li>\n<li>The conduct warrants suspension from school pursuant to Education Law 3214 and a suspension will be imposed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If the disruptive student does not pose a danger or ongoing threat of disruption to the academic process, the teacher must provide the student with an explanation for why they are being removed and an opportunity to explain their version of the relevant events before the student is removed.\u00a0 Only after the informal discussion may a teacher remove a student from class.<\/p>\n<p>If the student poses a danger or ongoing threat of disruption, the teacher may order the student to be removed immediately.\u00a0 The teacher must, however, explain to the student why they were removed from the classroom and give the student a chance to present their version of the relevant events by the end of the next school day.\u00a0 Every effort will be made to contact the parent by telephone as soon as the removal occurs.<\/p>\n<p>The teacher must contact the Principal or their designee as soon as possible.\u00a0 If the Principal or designee is not available by the end of the same school day, the teacher must submit written documentation of the<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"> <\/span>incident in an office referral.<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Within one school day after the student\u2019s removal, the Principal, or another District administrator designated by the Principal, must notify the student\u2019s parents, that the student has been removed from class and why.\u00a0 The notice must also inform the parent that they have the right, upon request, to meet informally with the Principal or the Principal\u2019s designee to discuss the reason(s) for the removal.<\/p>\n<p>The Principal may require the teacher who ordered the removal to attend the informal conference.\u00a0 If, at the informal meeting, the student denies the allegations, the Principal or the Principal\u2019s designee must explain why the student was removed and give the student and the student\u2019s parents a chance to present the student\u2019s version of the relevant events.\u00a0 The informal meeting must be held within two school days of the student\u2019s removal.\u00a0 The timing of the informal meeting may be extended by mutual agreement of the parent and Principal.<\/p>\n<p>Removal of a student with a disability, under certain circumstances, may constitute a change in the student\u2019s placement.\u00a0 Accordingly, no teacher may remove a student with a disability from their class until they have verified with the Principal or the chairperson of the Committee on Special Education that the removal will not violate the student\u2019s rights under state or federal law or regulation.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>5. Suspension from school<\/p>\n<p>Suspension from school is a severe consequence, which may be imposed only upon students who are insubordinate, disorderly, violent, or disruptive or whose conduct otherwise endangers the safety, morals, health or welfare of others.<\/p>\n<p>The Board of Education retains its authority to suspend students, but places primary responsibility for the suspension of students with the Superintendent and the building Principals.<\/p>\n<p>Any staff member may recommend to the Superintendent, their designee, or the Principal that a student be suspended. All staff members must immediately report and refer a violent student to the Principal for a violation of the Code of Conduct.\u00a0 All recommendations and referrals shall be made in writing unless the conditions underlying the recommendation or referral warrant immediate attention.\u00a0 In such cases, a written report is to be prepared as soon as possible by the staff member recommending the suspension.<\/p>\n<p>The suspending authority or Principal, upon receiving a recommendation or referral for suspension or when processing a case for suspension, shall gather the facts relevant to the matter and record them for subsequent presentation, if necessary.<\/p>\n<p>5.1 Short-term (5 days or less) suspension from school<\/p>\n<p>When the Superintendent or Principal (referred to as the \u201csuspending authority\u201d) proposes to suspend a student charged with misconduct for five days or less pursuant to Education Law \u00a73214(3), the suspending authority must immediately notify the student orally.\u00a0 If the student denies the misconduct, the suspending authority must provide an explanation of the basis for the proposed suspension.\u00a0 The suspending authority must also notify the student\u2019s parents in writing that the student may be suspended from school.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The written notice must be provided by personal delivery, express mail delivery or some other means that is reasonably calculated to assure receipt of the notice within 24 hours of the decision to propose suspension at the last known address for the parents.\u00a0 Where possible, notice should also be provided by telephone if the school has been provided with a telephone number(s) for the purpose of contacting the parents.<\/p>\n<p>The notice shall provide a description of the charges against the student and the incident for which suspension is proposed and shall inform the parents of the right to request an immediate, informal conference with the Principal. Both the notice and informal conference shall be in the dominant language or mode of communication used by the parents.\u00a0 At the conference, the parents shall be permitted to ask questions of complaining witnesses under such procedures as the Principal may establish.<\/p>\n<p>The notice and opportunity for an informal conference shall take place before the student is suspended unless the student\u2019s presence in school poses a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disruption to the academic process.\u00a0 If the student\u2019s presence does pose such a danger or threat of disruption, the notice and opportunity for an informal conference shall take place as soon as possible after the start date of the suspension.<\/p>\n<p>After the conference, the Principal shall promptly advise the parents in writing of their decision.\u00a0 The Principal shall advise the parents that if they are not satisfied with the decision and wish to pursue the matter, they must file a written appeal to the Superintendent within five business days, unless they can show extraordinary circumstances precluding them from doing so.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The Superintendent shall issue a written decision regarding the appeal within ten business days of receiving the appeal.\u00a0 If the parents are not satisfied with the Superintendent\u2019s decision, they must file a written appeal to the Board of Education with the District clerk within ten business days of the date of the Superintendent\u2019s decision, unless they can show extraordinary circumstances precluding them from doing so. Final decisions of the Board of Education may be appealed to the Commissioner within 30 days of the decision.<\/p>\n<p>5.2 Long-term (more than 5 days) suspension from school<\/p>\n<p>When the Superintendent determines that a suspension for more than five days may be warranted, the Superintendent shall give reasonable notice to the student and the student\u2019s parents of their right to a fair hearing.\u00a0 At the hearing, the student shall have the right to be represented by counsel, the right to question witnesses against them, and the right to present witnesses and other evidence on their behalf.<\/p>\n<p>The Superintendent shall personally hear and determine the proceeding or may, in their discretion, designate a hearing officer to conduct the hearing.\u00a0 The hearing officer shall be authorized to administer oaths and to issue subpoenas in conjunction with the proceeding before them.\u00a0 A record of the hearing shall be maintained, but no stenographic transcript shall be required.\u00a0 An audio recording shall be deemed a satisfactory record.\u00a0 The hearing officer shall make findings of fact and recommendations as to the appropriate measure of discipline to the Superintendent.\u00a0 The report of the hearing officer shall be advisory only and the Superintendent may accept all or any part thereof.<\/p>\n<p>An appeal of the decision of the Superintendent may be made to the Board of Education that will make its decision based solely upon the record before it.\u00a0 All appeals to the Board of Education must be in writing and submitted to the District clerk within ten business days of the date of the Superintendent\u2019s decision, unless the parents can show that extraordinary circumstances precluded them from doing so.\u00a0 The Board of Education may adopt in whole or in part the decision of the Superintendent.\u00a0 Final decisions of the Board of Education may be appealed to the Commissioner within 30 days of the decision.<\/p>\n<p><strong>C.

misconduct involving weapons, illegal drugs or controlled substances.<\/p>\n<p>If, subsequently, a student with a disability who has a behavioral intervention plan and who has been suspended or removed from their current educational placement for more than ten school days in a school year is subject to a suspension or removal that does not constitute a disciplinary change in placement, the

Police Involvement in Searches and Interrogations of Students<\/strong><br \/>\nDistrict officials are committed to cooperating with police officials and other law enforcement authorities to maintain a safe school environment.\u00a0 Police officials, however, have limited authority to interview or search students in schools or at school functions or to use school facilities in connection with police work.\u00a0 Police officials may enter school property or a school function to question or search a student or to conduct a formal investigation involving students only if they have<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A search or an arrest warrant; or<\/li>\n<li>Probable cause to believe a crime has been committed on school property or at a school function; or<\/li>\n<li>Been invited by school officials<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Before police officials are permitted to question or search any student, the Building Principal or their designee shall first try to notify the student\u2019s parent to give the parent the opportunity to be present during the police questioning or search.\u00a0 If the student\u2019s parent cannot be contacted prior to the police questioning or search, the questioning or search shall not be conducted.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><em>The above requirement does not apply to a School Resource Officer acting to assist the school administration in any school investigation.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Principal or designee will also be present during any police questioning or search of a student on school property or at a school function.<\/p>\n<p>Students who are questioned by police officials on school property or at a school function will be afforded the same rights they have outside the school.\u00a0 This means:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>They must be informed of their legal rights<\/li>\n<li>They may remain silent if they so desire<\/li>\n<li>They may request the presence of an attorney<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>D. Child Protective Services Investigations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Consistent with the District\u2019s commitment to keep students safe from harm and the obligation of school officials to report to Child Protective Services when they have reasonable cause to suspect that a student has been abused or maltreated, the District will cooperate with local Child Protective Services workers who wish to conduct interviews of students on school property relating to allegations of suspected child abuse and\/or neglect or custody investigations.<\/p>\n<p>All requests by Child Protective Services to interview a student on school property shall be made directly to Building Principal or their designee. The Principal or their designee shall set the time and place of the interview.\u00a0 The Principal or their designee shall decide if it is necessary and appropriate for a school official to be present during the interview, depending on the age of the student being interviewed and the nature of the allegations.<\/p>\n<p>If the nature of the allegations is such that it may be necessary for the student to remove any of their clothing in order for the Child Protective Services worker to verify the allegations, the school nurse or other District medical personnel must be present during that portion of the interview.\u00a0 No student may be required to remove their clothing in front of a Child Protective Services worker or District official of the opposite sex.<\/p>\n<p>A Child Protective Services worker may not remove a student from school property without a court order, unless the worker reasonably believes that the student would be subject to danger of abuse if they were not removed from school before a court order can reasonably be obtained.\u00a0\u00a0 If the worker believes the student would be subject to danger of abuse, the worker may invoke any rights and procedures to remove the student without a court order and without the parent\u2019s consent.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#TopPage\">Top of Page<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Visitors\"><\/a>XVI.
