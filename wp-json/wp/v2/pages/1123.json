Please note, our cut off time to pick up students is 2:00 pm.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>At the time requested, the individual picking up the student needs to come to the attendance office with a <strong>photo ID to sign the child out; at that time the student will be called down to the Main Office.<\/strong> Students <strong>cannot<\/strong> be released without a parent or guardian signature.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you pick up your child at regular dismissal time, a note is not required.\u00a0 Make arrangements directly with your child to meet at the student pick up area.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Visitors to Maple Avenue<\/h2>\n<p>In an effort to maintain safety and security for our building, all visitors are required to present a photo ID. Information such as name, date of birth, and photo will be digitally scanned into the system and the visitor will be issued a temporary photo ID for the duration of their visit. Once a visitor\u2019s information is in our system, we will be able to print a new photo ID for subsequent visits. You will need to present your photo ID each time. The information provided at the visitor station is secure, confidential, and will not be shared with any 3rd party group. Thank you in advance for your patience as we work toward improving both student safety and punctuality.<\/p>\n<h2>Emergency Evacuation Procedures<\/h2>\n<p><span>In the event that students must evacuate the building, they are to proceed out of the building via the emergency exit routes posted in each classroom. Students are to stay with their class and classroom teacher. They are to proceed out of the building at a safe, rapid pace, with no talking, and in an orderly fashion (no pushing, horseplay, etc.). <strong>Students, who are in the hallways not under the direct supervision of a teacher, are to exit via the nearest exit, locate an adult, and identify themselves.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Emergency School Closings<\/h2>\n<p>In the event of an emergency during school hours or an early dismissal, the District will use Parent Square to send an email, SMS text message and\/or phone notification to the Parent(s)\/Guardian(s) listed in SchoolTool. The building will follow your \u201cAnnual Parent Authorization Form\u201d that parents submit online at the beginning of the school year for the emergency closing plan of action for your children.<\/p>\n<p>Weather cancellations and delays are posted on the school district\u2019s website, right on the homepage at <u>www.saratogaschools.org<\/u>. The District will also send a ParentSquare email and SMS text message to families. The decision to close or delay the starting time of school will be made as early as possible.<\/p>\n<p>School closings are also announced through the media via the School Closing Network (which includes many local TV and radio stations as well as newspaper websites).\u00a0 Parents are urged to check the website or news stations for the announcements rather than call the school district.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Student I.D.<\/h2>\n<p>Students receive an ID card that has their name, photo, and student number barcode. IDs are used to board school buses, purchase lunches, check out books in the library, and attend student events such as dances. They are also a valuable security tool in quickly accounting for students on field trips or emergency evacuations. Students are required to carry their ID with them while on school grounds or attending school events. Please encourage your child to demonstrate responsibility by safeguarding their ID.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>DO NOT THROW AWAY YOUR OLD ID!!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Last year\u2019s identification card will still be used for the first few months of school until new photo IDs are issued. This will usually occur about 2-3 weeks after yearbook photos are taken.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>BIKING TO SCHOOL<\/h2>\n<p>It has been determined that currently there is a safe access point for your child to ride a bicycle to and from Maple Avenue Middle School.<\/p>\n<p>Below, please find some basic requirements (additional building-specific requirements may apply-contact the building principal for details) that must be adhered to for your child to receive permission from the building principal to ride a bicycle to and from our school.<\/p>\n<p>They are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both you and your child must review and sign the Bicycle Safety Agreement.<\/li>\n<li>You must complete a form so that your child\u2019s bicycle is registered in the Main Office.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please be advised that should your child fail to adhere to the requirements contained in the Bicycle Safety Agreement, your child may lose the privilege of riding their bicycle to and from school.<\/p>\n<p>Please refer to the Board of Education Policy 5453-Biking to School and the Administration Regulation 5453-R for more information and the Bicycle Safety Agreement. All district policies are in the Policy Manual on the school website (saratogaschools.org).<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>We strongly recommend that you accompany your child whenever your child rides their bicycle to and from our school.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Security Information<\/h2>\n<p><span>Events that may endanger the welfare of our students and staff are extraordinary and require a commitment to planning as well as coordinated action by our Building Emergency Response Team (BERT) to evaluate, lower the threat level and to work closely with local emergency providers once they enter school property. We have no control over when these events may occur. With this in mind, it is imperative that we implement a response system that includes the following<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensures the safety of students, staff and visitors.<\/li>\n<li>Protects district facilities, property and interests.<\/li>\n<li>Stabilizes the incident in a short period of time.<\/li>\n<li>Provides support to and works collaboratively with emergency providers.<\/li>\n<li>Communicates effectively with parents and media.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In order to ensure that our students and staff remain safe during the school day, please adhere to the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>During each visit to our school, please be sure to report to the main office, present a photo ID, sign in and receive a visitor\u2019s badge.<\/li>\n<li>Report directly to the location you designated on the sign-in sheet and return to the main office after leaving your designated location to sign out of the building.<\/li>\n<li>If your intended designation in the building is changed, or altered, you must report this change immediately to the main office.<\/li>\n<li>Report any suspicious and\/or unusual activity observed on school property to the building principal or building staff.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Gun Free Schools<\/h2>\n<p>It is important for all members of the public to understand that it is illegal for any firearm or weapon to be brought onto school property by an individual other than a peace officer or law enforcement official in the discharge of legal duties. The Saratoga Springs City School District Board of Education may grant permission for individuals that have been designated by the District to carry a firearm while performing their duties while on campus. According to the Gun Free Schools Act, starter pistols, explosives, other weapons able to expel a projectile, even portions of a workable weapon, are all covered under this legislation. This information is extremely important, not only for students who could suffer severe penalties of up to one-year removal from school, as well as mandatory referral to law enforcement or juvenile delinquency officials for prosecution, but also for parents and community members who might also face legal prosecution for violating this Act.<\/p>\n<p>The full impact of this legislation makes it illegal for someone to drive onto school property with a firearm or similarly defined weapon in their possession or in their vehicle. In accordance with a weapon being on the school grounds, this gun free school zone law applies to within 1000 ft. of the school building. Additionally, this law applies to not only \u201cthe school district property\u201d, but this law then also applies to all school events held on or off campus. This means a parent returning from a day of hunting should not have a rifle or shotgun in their vehicle if they come to school to pick up their child or attend an evening meeting. Beyond strict compliance with the law, there is also the concern for the potential of some unintended tragedy whenever firearms are brought into close contact with large numbers of people, including children. Please use particular caution in the fall when so many citizens may be involved in hunting or target shooting activities.<\/p>\n<h2>Automated External Defibrillators<\/h2>\n<p>The Saratoga Springs City School District maintains on site, in each instructional school facility and at the district office, at least one functional automated external defibrillator (AED) for use during emergencies.\u00a0 Whenever public-school facilities are used for school-sponsored or school-approved curricular or extracurricular events or activities or a school-sponsored athletic contest is held at any location, school administrators shall ensure the presence of at least one staff person who is trained in the operation and use of an AED.\u00a0 Where a school-sponsored competitive athletic event is held at a site other than a public-school facility, the public-school officials must ensure that AED equipment is provided on-site.<\/p>\n<h2>Health Services<\/h2>\n<p>The health office provides preventive services, education, emergency care, and management of acute and chronic health conditions.\u00a0 The office is staffed by two registered nurses and a clerk.\u00a0 Their services are available to all students.\u00a0 Parents are encouraged to call the school nurse at (518) 587-4551 ext. 12040 or (518) 682-2676 to discuss any student health related concerns or updates.<\/p>\n<p>New York State Education Law requires the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each student must have a physical examination on file upon entrance to the school district and for all 7<span><sup>th<\/sup><\/span> Parents can mail a copy of their child&#8217;s physical to the school with attention to the health office. It may also be faxed directly to (518) 583-4723.<\/li>\n<li>Students entering 6<span><sup>th<\/sup><\/span> grade must have documented proof of the Tdap vaccination and students entering 7<sup>th<\/sup> grade are required to have documented proof of the first meningococcal vaccine. Proof of vaccinations must be received within 14 days from the first day of school or the student will be excluded until the vaccination is received. If the student is coming from out of state, they will have 30 days, instead of 14.<\/li>\n<li>PLEASE NOTE: Tdap can be given at age 10 but is not required until the child turns 11. They will have 14 days from their birthday to provide documented proof, or the student will be excluded from school.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Please refer to the district website regarding NYS Department of Health immunization requirements for students in grades 6-8.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<p>Physical Education is a state mandated program.\u00a0 Therefore, if a student has an injury and will need to miss more than one day of gym, a doctor&#8217;s note must be turned into the health office. If a student requires crutches and\/or use of an elevator, the doctor must write this along with the gym excuse.<\/p>\n<p>All medications and health needs should be addressed with the nurses prior to the start of school.\u00a0 There are procedures that must be followed for the dispensing of medication.<\/p>\n<p>The nurses are not allowed to give out any medications, including cough drops and Tylenol unless a doctor\u2019s order is provided.

Students will begin to establish their personal identities as readers and writers through choice, discussion, collaboration, and presentation.\u00a0 The curriculum will include daily practice with rigorous and authentic reading and writing tasks for all language arts <\/span><span>learners, from the reluctant to the proficient.\u00a0 The goal of the Grade 6 ELA Program is to engage students in learning experiences that foster the development of an attitude of enjoyment, capability, and empowerment in language arts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Mathematics 6-8<\/h2>\n<p>Mathematics instruction for grades 6 \u2013 8 follows the New York State Next Generation Learning Standards. Instruction will help students develop and cultivate skills and knowledge based on mathematical practices such as problem solving, reasoning, modeling, precision, and critical thinking.\u00a0 Students will be challenged to make sense of problems, persevere in solving them to build foundational skills, and make sense of real-world applications. \u00a0Each grade level math course meets for a full block twice every three days.<\/p>\n<h3>Math 6 Math Skills<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to their regular Math 6 class, all 6<sup>th<\/sup> grade students are enrolled in the Grade 6 Math Skills course which meets once every three days.\u00a0\u00a0 The Math Skills class provides additional time for instruction, support and guided practice with the 6<sup>th<\/sup> grade math standards.\u00a0 The Math Skills teachers and the Math 6 Class teachers collaborate to ensure cohesive instruction.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Math Acceleration<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The Accelerated Pathway is designed for students who consistently demonstrate advanced levels of mathematical understanding and application, as well as advanced levels of proficiency in math content.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MATH 7 ACC<\/strong> &#8211;<\/p>\n<p>Math 7 Accelerated combines 7th and 8th grade essential next generation math standards into a demanding one-year course.\u00a0 Students enrolled in 7ACC are expected to maintain an average of 80% or higher to achieve success in the program.\u00a0 Students are selected for accelerated math based on their performance on a placement test, the most recent I-Ready diagnostic score, Math 6 assessment scores, and teacher feedback on homework completion, math fact fluency, class participation, and work ethic. Students interested in enrolling in accelerated math must be willing and eager to extend themselves academically. Upon successful completion of the Math 7 Accelerated course, students will then be eligible to take Algebra 1, a high school Regents math course, in 8<sup>th<\/sup> grade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ON RAMP<\/strong> \u2013 Students who perform exceptionally well in Math 7 and perform well on a separate placement test (in 7th grade) may be invited to participate in our On-Ramp Program, a rigorous after-school program targeting the essential 8th grade Next Generation standards necessary. Successful completion of this program results in enrollment in Regents Algebra I in 8th grade. Acceptance into the On Ramp program is based on the same criteria listed above.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ALGEBRA I<\/strong> \u2013 This course follows the NYS Next Generation Standards for Algebra I, a course typically offered at the high school level. The fundamental purpose of this course is to formalize and extend the mathematics that students learned in the middle grades. Because it is built on the middle grades\u2019 standards, this is a more ambitious version of Algebra I than has generally been offered. Students enrolled in Algebra I are expected to maintain an average of 80% or higher to achieve success in the program. Students enrolling in accelerated math must be willing and eager to extend themselves academically. It is important to emphasize that performance in Algebra I and a student\u2019s score on the Regents Exam will become part of a student\u2019s high school transcript. A STUDENT WHO WISHES TO DROP ALGEBRA I MUST DO SO BY THE END OF THE 2nd MARKING PERIOD.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF MY CHILD DOES NOT ACCELERATE IN MATH AT ALL?<\/strong>\u00a0It must be emphasized that if students do not accelerate in grade 7 or 8, the opportunity to take honors level math classes and AP courses at the high school level is not closed.\u00a0 These options remain a possibility throughout high school so long as aptitude and high academic performance are demonstrated, and other prerequisites are met.<\/p>\n<h2>Science 6-8<\/h2>\n<h3>Philosophy and Mission<\/h3>\n<p>Science challenges students to question, explore and assess the world around us and seek out answers.\u00a0 Our science department teaches essential 21<span><sup>st<\/sup><\/span> century skills necessary in any future career.\u00a0 We believe that students learn best when engaged in activities that are not simply hands-on but more importantly minds-on.\u00a0 Through teacher-led demonstrations, students conduct laboratory investigations, and other problem-solving activities, we strive to engage students while helping to illustrate the often-abstract concepts of science. All science curriculum is aligned to the New York State Science Learning Standards.<\/p>\n<h3>Curriculum Overview<\/h3>\n<p><strong>SCIENCE 6<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Science 6 curriculum is an introduction to middle school science and engineering practices.\u00a0 This includes the exploration of life science topics such as ecology, cycles in nature, the Earth\u2019s ecosystems, cell structure, and heredity<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>SCIENCE 7<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Science 7 curriculum investigates planet Earth.\u00a0 Students will learn about the Earth\u2019s internal and external structure and the reasons for many natural phenomena such as earthquakes and volcanoes.\u00a0 In laboratory activities, students will learn to make accurate measurements and record data in an organized form with correct units.\u00a0 Students also will learn about the underlying physics behind activities on Earth.\u00a0 <span><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>SCIENCE 8<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Science 8 curriculum incorporates many demonstrations and laboratory activities in chemistry and physics.

It is reviewed and updated as necessary each year. The complete Code of Conduct, which has been approved by the Saratoga Springs City School District Board of Education, is available online and in every school building for parent and community review. Any questions or clarifications may be requested from School District and building administrators. The complete Code of Conduct can be accessed on the District website (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\">www.saratogaschools.org<\/a>). A link to<\/em><br \/>\n<em>a translation tool is also available on our website<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Attendance Policy<br \/>\nPlain Language Summary<\/h2>\n<p>Education law and Board of Education policy requires that every child attaining the age of six and through the age of sixteen attend school during regular school hours for a minimum of 180 days per year unless excluded by provisions of the law as described below. The attendance policy is built on the belief that regular attendance increases student achievement, reduces drop-out levels and develops positive attitudes toward school and learning.<\/p>\n<p>Parents\/guardians are required to provide a written excuse within a two-week period of the absence, indicating the reasons for any absence, tardiness, or leaving school early. Parents are asked to call the attendance office of the school whenever a child is going to be absent. Parents are contacted by the attendance office if a child is absent, and the school has not received prior notice by the parent\/guardian.<\/p>\n<p><span>Excused absences include tardiness, and early departure from class or school due to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>personal illness<\/li>\n<li>serious illness or death in the family<\/li>\n<li>religious observance or education during school hours with a signed written request<\/li>\n<li>required court appearances of the student<\/li>\n<li>required medical appointments of the student<\/li>\n<li>approved college visits of the student<\/li>\n<li>military obligations of the student<\/li>\n<li>school sponsored activities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At the discretion of the Superintendent, a student may be granted a maximum number of excused absences so that the student has the opportunity to spend time with their parent or legal guardian who is about to be deployed, returning for a mid-deployment break or being discharged from military service.<\/p>\n<p>All other absences, tardies and early dismissals are considered unexcused and illegal. Examples are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>truancy<\/li>\n<li>family vacations<\/li>\n<li>babysitting<\/li>\n<li>work during school hours<\/li>\n<li>hunting, fishing, oversleeping, missing the bus, etc.<\/li>\n<li>no parent\/guardian written note for an otherwise excusable absence<\/li>\n<li>accompanying a parent\/guardian on an appointment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When a student has a planned unexcused absence of 11 or more consecutive school days, parents must fill out and submit an Individualized Home Instruction Plan (IHIP) to the Office of Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment.<\/p>\n<p>Administrative procedures ensure that student attendance is monitored on a regular basis; that there are systems in place to acknowledge a student\u2019s efforts to maintain or improve school attendance: and that there are means to monitor and communicate attendance records with parents\/guardians and agencies, as appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes and are held accountable for work missed due to absence, whether the absence is excused or unexcused. If a student is truant, appropriate consequences will be imposed. Attendance is taken daily in grades K-12.<\/p>\n<p>Continuous monitoring will be conducted to identify students who are absent, tardy, or leave class or school early. A student will be considered chronically absent if they miss ten percent or more of the school year. Satisfactory attendance is missing five percent or less of school over the course of the year. If a pattern of attendance concerns for an individual student is identified, a designated staff person(s) will follow-up in accordance with Policy 5100 Student Attendance.<\/p>\n<h3>Attendance Incentives, Sanctions, and Interventions<\/h3>\n<p>The district will design and implement systems to acknowledge a student\u2019s efforts to maintain or improve school attendance. This includes, but is not limited to, the following actions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>At all grade levels, improving the school climate through student feedback in order to provide a safe, supportive school environment and engage students in school.<\/li>\n<li>At all grade levels, actively engaging students, and families in school determining systematic barriers to school attendance and developing solutions to remove those barriers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Harassment<\/h2>\n<p>It is the policy of the Saratoga Springs City School District that harassment and discrimination based upon actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or other legally protected category is unacceptable conduct and will not be tolerated. This is in keeping with efforts to establish an environment in which the dignity and worth of each member of the school community is respected. The goal of the district is to provide a community in which all students and staff are accepted and judged as individuals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sexual harassment<\/strong> of any member of the school community by an individual is prohibited on school property or in connection with school-related activities. The Board recognizes that sexual harassment can be committed by a person of either sex against a person of either the same or opposite sex, and by peers as well as supervisors. The Board strongly condemns all forms of sexual harassment and is committed to safeguarding the right of each student to learn in an environment that is free from sexual harassment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Harassment<\/strong> includes offensive epithets or slurs, derogatory jokes, graffiti, and other offensive verbal or non-verbal conduct related to an individual\u2019s race, color, religion, national origin, real or perceived sexual orientation, or disability when:<\/p>\n<p>Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s academic performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment in the classroom, or other school-related forum.<\/p>\n<h3>Complaint Processing<\/h3>\n<p>In accordance with the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, parents and guardians have the right to request specific information about the professional qualifications of their children&#8217;s classroom teachers. As a parent\/guardian of a student in the Saratoga Springs City School District, you have the right to request the following information:<\/p>\n<h2>Parental Right to Request and Review Information Regarding Teacher Qualifications<\/h2>\n<p>In accordance with the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, parents and guardians have the right to request specific information about the professional qualifications of their children&#8217;s classroom teachers.

Thank you for your continued support and interest in your child&#8217;s education.<\/p>\n<h2>Student Privacy<\/h2>\n<p>The Board recognizes its responsibility to enact policies that protect student privacy, in accordance with law. This is particularly relevant in the context of the administration of surveys that collect personal information, the disclosure of personal information for marketing purposes and in conducting physical exams.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Surveys <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Board of Education recognizes that student surveys are a valuable tool in determining student needs for educational services. In accordance with law and Board policy, parental consent is required for minors to take part in surveys which gather any of the following information:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>political affiliations or beliefs of the student or the student&#8217;s parent;<\/li>\n<li>mental or psychological problems of the student or the student&#8217;s family;<\/li>\n<li>sex behavior or attitudes;<\/li>\n<li>illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating or demeaning behavior;<\/li>\n<li>critical appraisals of other individuals with whom respondents have close family relationships;<\/li>\n<li>legally recognized privileged or analogous relationships, such as those of lawyers, physicians and ministers;<\/li>\n<li>religious practices, affiliations or beliefs of the student, the student&#8217;s parent or<\/li>\n<li>income (other than that required by law to determine eligibility for participation in a program or for receiving financial assistance under such program).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In the event that the district plans to survey students to gather information included in the list above, the district will obtain written consent from the parent\/guardian in advance of administering the survey. The notification\/consent form will also apprise the parent\/guardian of their right to inspect the survey prior to their child\u2019s participation.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Marketing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is the policy of the Board not to collect, disclose, or use personal information gathered from students for the purpose of marketing or selling that information or providing it to others for that purpose. This does not apply to the collection, disclosure, or use of personal information collected from students for the exclusive purpose of developing, evaluating, or providing educational products or services for, or to students or educational institutions such as:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>College or other postsecondary education recruitment, or military recruitment;<\/li>\n<li>Book clubs, magazines and programs providing access to low-cost literary products;<\/li>\n<li>Curriculum and instructional materials used in schools;<\/li>\n<li>Tests and assessments used to provide cognitive, evaluative, diagnostic, clinical, aptitude, or achievement information for students or to generate other statistically useful data for the purpose of securing such tests and assessments, and the subsequent analysis and public release of the aggregate data from such tests and assessments;<\/li>\n<li>Student recognition programs; and<\/li>\n<li>The sale by students of products or services to raise funds for school-related activities.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In the event that such data is collected by the district, disclosure or use of student personal information will be protected by the district pursuant to the requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy act (FERPA). [For guidance regarding the disclosure of \u201cdirectory information,\u201d rather than personal information, see policy 5500, Student Records.]<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Inspection of Instructional Material<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Parents\/Guardians shall have the right to inspect, upon request, any instructional material used as part of the educational curriculum for students. Instructional content is defined as that information provided to a student, regardless of format, including printed or representational materials, audio-visual materials, and materials in electronic or digital formats. It does not include tests or academic assessments in advance of administration of such assessments.<\/p>\n<p>A parent\/guardian who wishes to inspect and review such instructional material shall submit a request in writing to the Building Principal. Arrangements shall be made to provide access to such material within a reasonable time after the request has been received.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Invasive Physical Examinations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Parents\/Guardians have the right to submit a written statement to opt their child out of participation in the administration of any non-emergency, invasive physical examination or screening that is required as a condition of attendance, administered by the school not necessary to protect the immediate health or safety of the student or other students and not otherwise permitted or required by state law. <u>Hearing, vision and scoliosis screenings are not subject to prior notification.<\/u><\/p>\n<h4>Notification<\/h4>\n<p><span>Parents\/guardians and eligible students shall be notified at least annually, at the beginning of the school year, and when enrolling students for the first time in district schools of this policy. The School District shall also notify parents\/guardians within a reasonable period after any substantive change to this policy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Data Protection Policies<\/h3>\n<p>Parent\/guardians and students should also be aware that the Board of Education has specific policies concerning the care and protection of student data by the District and third-party vendors the District contracts with for services. Such policies include Information and Data Privacy Security, Breach, and Notification (Policy 8635).<\/p>\n<h2>Rights Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)<\/h2>\n<p>This is to advise you of your rights with respect to student records pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of student records. The law gives parents and students over 18 years of age (referred to in the law as \u201celigible students\u201d) the following rights:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The right to inspect and review the student\u2019s education records within 45 days of the day the district receives a request for access. Parents or eligible students should submit to the Building Principal a written request that identifies the records they wish to inspect. The Principal will make arrangements for access and notify the parent or eligible student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.<\/p>\n<p>2. The right to request the amendment of the student\u2019s education records that the parent or eligible student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Parents or eligible students may ask the district to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading by writing the Principal, clearly identifying the part of the record they want changed and specifying why it is inaccurate or misleading. Please note that the amendment procedure may not be used to challenge a grade, an opinion, or a substantive decision made by the School District about a student.<\/p>\n<p>If the District decides not to amend the record as requested by the parent or eligible student, the district will notify the parent or eligible student of the decision and advise them of their right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the parent or eligible student when notified of the right to a hearin<\/p>\n<p>3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student\u2019s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. There is an exception to FERPA\u2019s prohibition against non-consensual disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, pursuant to which the district may disclose personally identifiable information from education records without consent.<\/p>\n<p>One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to \u201cschool officials\u201d with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the district as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel); a person serving on the school board; a person or company with whom the district has contracted to perform a special task (such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist); or a parent or student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing their tasks. With respect to what constitutes a \u2018legitimate education interest\u2019, it is generally accepted that a school official generally has a legitimate education interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill their professional responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>\nA student\/parent who believes there has been a violation of the provisions of FERPA may file a complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20202-5920. Complaints must contain specific allegations of fact giving reasonable cause to believe that a violation of FERPA has occurred.

The policy shall also be published in appropriate school and district publications. \u00a0All staff involved in implementing and enforcing this policy shall also be notified of these requirements and their responsibilities.<\/p>\n<p>Unpaid meal charges are a financial burden to the district and taxpayers and can negatively affect the school program. Unpaid meal charges shall be considered &#8220;delinquent&#8221; as per the district&#8217;s accounting practices. The district shall attempt to recover unpaid meal charges before the end of the school year but may continue efforts into the next school year. The district shall notify parents\/guardians of unpaid meal charges at regular intervals, and may engage in collection activities by district staff, which do not involve debt collectors as defined in federal law (15 USC {1692a) and may not charge fees or interest or file a lawsuit against students&#8217; parents or guardians. The district shall offer repayment plans and may take other actions that do not result in harm or shame to the child, until unpaid charges are paid.<\/p>\n<p>The remaining funds may be carried over to the next school year. When students leave the district or graduate, the district will attempt to contact the parent\/guardian to return the remaining funds. Parents\/guardians may request that funds be transferred to other students<\/p>\n<p>(e.g., siblings, unpaid accounts). All transfer requests must be in writing.

The major objectives of the pupil transportation program are to provide safe transportation, operate an efficient and economical transportation system, adapt transportation to the requirements of the instructional program, and maintain conditions on the buses which are conducive to the best interest of students.<\/p>\n<h3>Philosophy<\/h3>\n<p><span>The school bus is considered an extension of the school; therefore, the safety and welfare of all pupils riding school buses is a major responsibility of the School District. Bus discipline, in order to be effective, must be a cooperative effort involving the transportation department, administrators, parents and pupils.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Roles\/Responsibilities<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Transportation personnel will receive orientation on a regularly scheduled basis regarding general discipline, pupil behavior, pupil rights, bus rules and disciplinary procedures.<\/li>\n<li>Bus drivers, teachers and administrators will be responsible for orienting pupils on a regularly scheduled basis regarding bus behavior.<\/li>\n<li>Pupils will be under the authority and supervision of the bus driver while on the bus and will be expected to adhere to directions at all times.<\/li>\n<li>Bus expectations will be published and distributed to parents\/guardians, pupils and bus drivers, and they will be posted on every bus.<\/li>\n<li>Pupils who are disorderly and insubordinate will be subject to disciplinary actions.<\/li>\n<li>Disciplinary action for misbehavior will be the responsibility of building administrators in collaboration with the Director of Transportation (or their designee).<\/li>\n<li>Disciplinary action will be reasonable and administered in a progressive manner with pupil\u2019s rights to due process guaranteed.<\/li>\n<li>The principal or Director of Transportation (or their designee) will be responsible for notifying parents\/guardians of disciplinary action resulting from bus referrals in order to obtain their support and cooperation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Unauthorized Entry on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>For safety and security reasons, unauthorized persons are not allowed to board or ride a school bus at any time, unless prior approval has been received from the transportation department. This includes parents\/guardians, daycare providers, siblings and underage children.<\/p>\n<h3>Student RFID (Radio-frequency identification) Cards<\/h3>\n<p><span>Students are issued RFID Cards that are used for attendance and accountability purposes on school buses. When the student boards and leaves the school bus, they are required to scan their card on the card reader in the bus. This will verify that the student has boarded or left the school bus, as well as display on the driver\u2019s Mobile Data Terminal and at the transportation dispatch office. The following pertains to the use of RFID Cards:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Students are required to use their RFID Card when boarding and leaving the bus each day. The bus driver will remind students of this requirement if they fail to use their card.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0If a student repetitively fails to scan their card when entering\/exiting the bus, or consistently loses their card, drivers may submit written discipline referrals.<\/li>\n<li>3. If a student has not received an RFID Card, they should let their building principal know immediately so they can order one for the student. All initial cards are free of charge. For lost or missing RFID cards, parents and\/or students will need to order a replacement card on the district\u2019s website by going to \u201cFamily Links &amp; Resources\u201d and then scrolling down to \u201cStudent ID Replacement.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Reporting School Bus Incidents\/Concerns<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>If the incident\/concern specifically relates to the bus driver or bus driver assistant, please call the Transportation Department at (518) 587-4545 (inform receptionist).<\/li>\n<li>If the incident\/concern is student discipline related and on the school bus:\n<ol>\n<li>The first step is to inform the driver, who will take the appropriate steps<br \/>\nto address the concern.<\/li>\n<li>If this does not resolve the problem, inform your building team.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>If the concern involves bus routing or bus stops, please email the Transportation Routing Office at <a href=\"mailto:routing@saratogaschools.org\">routing@saratogaschools.org<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Any other bus concerns may be directed to the Bus Dispatch Office at (518) 693-1316.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Bus Behavior Expectations<\/h3>\n<p>Students should always conduct themselves in a manner consistent with established standards for classroom behavior in accordance with the Code of Conduct.<\/p>\n<p>Inappropriate student behavior can cause the driver to become distracted, which can increase the chances of the bus being involved in an accident.<\/p>\n<p>The following \u201cBus Behavior Expectations\u201d are posted in each school bus:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible<\/li>\n<li>Follow driver instructions the first time<\/li>\n<li>Remain seated in your assigned seat at all times<\/li>\n<li>Keep aisle, windows &amp; emergency exits clear<\/li>\n<li>Use an inside voice at all times.

Transportation conferences may also be utilized for students accumulating 10 bus referrals and 20 days of bus suspension during a school year.<\/p>\n<h3>Transportation Changes<\/h3>\n<p><span>Student transportation is scheduled to and from the student&#8217;s primary residence. If transportation is needed to a different location on a regular basis for daycare or joint custody purposes, the parent\/guardian must complete a Transportation Change Form.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Transportation Change Forms must be renewed on a yearly basis by June 1st for the following school year. Forms received after August 15th will not be processed until after the first week of school. For changes during the school year, submit as soon as possible.<\/li>\n<li>Only students in grades K \u2013 8 are eligible for transportation changes for daycare purposes.<\/li>\n<li>Transportation is available to accredited daycare centers within the School District boundaries. If your elementary school children will be attending private or homebased daycare, that location must be within the boundaries of the elementary school in which they attend.<\/li>\n<li>Requests will be approved on an annual basis as long as seating is available on<br \/>\nestablished bus routes. Additional buses will not be added to accommodate transportation change requests.<\/li>\n<li>Students are not allowed to ride a different bus for social functions, jobs (including babysitting), scouting, religious activities or any other non-approved activity as determined by the building principal.<\/li>\n<li>Students who are not eligible for transportation are not permitted to ride home with a friend for an afterschool activity.<\/li>\n<li>In the event of an emergency and your child needs to ride a different bus or get off at a different stop on the same bus, please send a note to the school with your child. The note must then be approved by the school office. If an emergency occurs during the day, please contact your child\u2019s school office as soon as possible to arrange for alternate transportation.<\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>Transportation Change Requests: Parent\/guardian completes and submits the electronic \u201cTransportation Change Request\u201d form on the school district website.\u00a0 Assistance with this process can also be found at the Transportation Department, the Registrar\u2019s office or each of the District\u2019s six elementary school offices.\u00a0 Upon receiving an approval\/denial from the Transportation Department, the Transportation Department notifies the parent\/guardian of the decision.\u00a0 Elementary Schools are also notified by the Transportation Department and are provided updated bus schedule information.\u00a0 Requests received after August 15th may not be honored until after school begins. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Bus Schedule Information<\/h3>\n<p><span>The Traversa My Ride K-12 mobile app and website provides secure access to \u201creal time\u201d student transportation information, student ID card scans, current bus location <\/span><span>and estimated arrival time at the bus stop.\u00a0 Instructions to access Traversa MY Ride K-12 can be found on the Transportation Webpage on the district website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Students should be at their bus stop 5 minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive in the morning.<\/p>\n<p>If you have bus routing questions, please email the routing office at:<br \/>\n<a href=\"mailto:routing@saratogaschools.org\">routing@saratogaschools.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Assigned Seating on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>The School District reserves the right to assign student seating on school buses for safety, efficiency and disciplinary reasons. In addition, assigned seating is required on all middle school and elementary buses and may be assigned on middle and high school buses if needed for behavioral issues. Drivers should have assigned seats in place by early October after considering grade level, compatibility, behaviors, siblings, friends etc. Assigned seats are also subject to change at any time during the school year.<\/p>\n<h3>Dangerous Substances<\/h3>\n<p>D.O.T. regulations prohibit aerosol cans, glass containers and flammable substances inside the passenger compartment of school buses. Therefore, students shall not carry these items on school buses at any time. Perfumes and colognes shall not be discharged on school buses because they can cause an adverse allergic reaction with some individuals.<\/p>\n<h3>Food and Beverages on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>New York State Education Department regulations prohibit eating or drinking on the bus. The reason for this regulation is due to the danger of a child choking when eating on a school bus and due to students, who have food allergies. So, please remember, no eating or drinking on the bus at any time.<\/p>\n<h3>Transporting Large Items on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>For the safety of all occupants being transported on district school buses, the following guidelines have been established to provide information on the size of items that students may transport on school buses.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objects smaller than 36 inches (length) by 12 inches (width) by 8 inches (depth) can be transported on school buses. These items must be kept on the student&#8217;s lap or on the floor between their legs. They must not obstruct the center aisle of the bus or be placed in a seat alongside a student, especially if another student needs to sit there.<\/li>\n<li>Objects that can obstruct or impair the vision of the driver are prohibited.<\/li>\n<li>Hockey and lacrosse sticks are allowed to be transported on the bus but must be stored behind the driver&#8217;s seat.<\/li>\n<li>Any items that are larger than the sizes listed above must be transported by other means, or arrangements may be made to store the items in the school. This includes large athletic equipment bags, skis, ski poles, sleds, skateboards, bicycles and fishing poles.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This policy is designed to provide the safest environment for all occupants riding on our school buses. If you have questions regarding this policy, please contact the Transportation Department at (518) 587-4545.<\/p>\n<h3>Use of Personal Electronic Devices on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>Improper use of electronics on the school bus can cause a distraction to the driver and may be detrimental to the safety and well-being of other students and bus drivers. Therefore, the following guidelines are provided in accordance with the district&#8217;s Code of Conduct policy.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cell phones and other electronic communication devices shall not be used to bully, discriminate, threaten, harass or denigrate other students or school personnel.<\/li>\n<li>Devices may not be used while boarding\/discharging or crossing, and during emergency situations or school bus safety drills unless authorized by the driver.<\/li>\n<li>Video\/audio recordings and pictures are not allowed to be taken by students riding District buses.<\/li>\n<li>Laser pointers and other objects that can obstruct or impair the vision of the driver are not allowed to be used on school buses at any time.<\/li>\n<li>iPods, tablets or other similar electronic devices may be used on school buses only if equipped with headphones and the volume is maintained at a level that does not disrupt the driver or other students.<\/li>\n<li>Headphones must be used when listening to music, playing games or viewing content on devices. For student safety reasons headphones must be removed when entering\/exiting the bus or crossing at bus stops.<\/li>\n<li>Any devices that are being used inappropriately may be confiscated by bus drivers and returned to the students when they depart the bus. If a student continues to use their device inappropriately, a discipline referral may be submitted, and the device may be confiscated and returned only to a parent\/guardian.<\/li>\n<li>The School District will not be held responsible for the loss or theft of any personal electronic device.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Failure to follow these and any bus rules may result in disciplinary action in accordance with the Code of Conduct.<\/p>\n<h3>Late Buses<\/h3>\n<p><span>Late buses operate from the High School and Middle School on a schedule set by each school.\u00a0 The following are the guidelines for late runs: <\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Students are required to submit a late run pass to the bus driver as well as scan their school provided ID card upon boarding the bus. The pass must be signed by a teacher and approved by the school\u2019s office. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Late run route zone maps are available on the School District\u2019s website. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span> <\/span><span>As there are only a limited number of buses for each school, ride times will vary depending on the number of students riding on a given day.
