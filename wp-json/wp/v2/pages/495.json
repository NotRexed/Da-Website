The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) makes a range of educational opportunities available to children with moderate to severe disabilities who are three and four years old. The program is managed by the Saratoga Springs City School District with financial oversight provided by the Saratoga County Youth Bureau. The district does not operate nor supervise any preschool services. Children are served at any one of several county-approved private agency sites in the area, or through home-based and community-based programs. Saratoga County arranges transportation through private providers.<\/p>\n<h2>Who is eligible?<\/h2>\n<p>Any child age between the ages of 36 months (3 years) and 60 months (5 years) residing in the school district who is experiencing significant difficulties or delays in development, whether physical, mental, or emotional, can be referred for service. Areas of concern can include difficulties in developing speech and language skills, thinking skills, motor skills or social skills. An assessment is conducted by a state approved evaluation agency to determine if your child qualifies for the Special Education Preschool Program.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to refer your child to the Committee on Special Education, please call Evelina Schretzlmeir at 518-693-1417.<\/p>\n<h2>Intake Documents<\/h2>\n<p>You will be required to present Proof of Residency, Proof of Student\u2019s age (Birth Certificate), copy of most recent physical, custody agreements, if applicable, and photo identification of both parents.
