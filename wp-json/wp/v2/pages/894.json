The agenda serves as an excellent resource for students organizationally, and for parents\/guardians to monitor their child\u2019s progress and assignments in the classroom. The agendas can also serve as an effective communication tool between parents\/guardians and teachers. Your classroom teacher and\/or building will provide further details about the use of agendas.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Annual Contact Verification and Parent Authorizations<\/h2>\n<p>To ensure the safety and well-being of all students, it is imperative that all contact information in SchoolTool remains accurate and up to date.<\/p>\n<p>The 2025\u20132026 Annual Contact Verification and Parent Authorizations Form will be distributed via ParentSquare in late August. This form allows parents and guardians to review and update emergency contact details (names, addresses, phone numbers, contact\u2019s pick-up approval, etc.) and complete required authorizations.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The submission window will remain open until mid-September.<\/li>\n<li>During this time, updates can be made directly through ParentSquare.<\/li>\n<li>After the deadline, paper copies of the Parent Authorizations Form (including FERPA, field trips, etc.) will be available in your school&#8217;s main office.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your contact information changes at any point during the school year, please complete the Change of Information Form available on our school website.<\/p>\n<p>Important: If your contact information is not current, the school may be unable to reach you in the event of an emergency or school closure due to inclement weather.<\/p>\n<p>All student contact information is securely maintained in the health\/main office for emergency use. If a parent or guardian cannot be reached, another designated adult listed in SchoolTool will be contacted.<\/p>\n<p>For non-emergency situations, students will only be released to individuals authorized in writing by the parent or guardian. In the case of illness or injury, if a parent\/guardian cannot be reached, those listed in SchoolTool, with pick up rights, will be authorized to pick up the student.<\/p>\n<h2>Attendance Policy for the District<\/h2>\n<p>Plain Language Summary (Based on Policy 5100 Student Attendance, 1\/6\/22, Revised: 10\/13\/22)<\/p>\n<p><span>Education law and Board of Education policy requires that every child attaining the age of six and through the age of sixteen attend school during regular school hours for a minimum of 180 days per year unless excluded by provisions of the law as described below. The attendance policy is built on the belief that regular attendance increases student achievement, reduces drop-out levels, and develops positive attitudes toward school and learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Parents\/guardians are required to provide a written excuse, within a two-week period of the absence, indicating the reasons for any absence, tardiness, or leaving school early. Parents\/guardians are asked to contact the school&#8217;s attendance office when a child is going to be absent. Parents\/guardians are contacted by the attendance office if a child is absent, and the school has not received prior notice from the parent\/guardian.<\/p>\n<p>Excused absences include, tardiness, and early departure from class or school due to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>personal illness<\/li>\n<li>serious illness or death in the family<\/li>\n<li>religious observance or education during school hours with a signed written request<\/li>\n<li>required court appearances of the student<\/li>\n<li>required medical appointments of the student<\/li>\n<li>approved college visits of the student<\/li>\n<li>military obligations of the student<\/li>\n<li>school sponsored activities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span>At the discretion of the Superintendent, a student may be granted a maximum number of excused absences so that the student can spend time with their parent or legal guardian who is about to be deployed, returning for a mid-deployment break, or being discharged from military service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>All other absences, tardies and early dismissals are considered unexcused and illegal. Examples are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>truancy<\/li>\n<li>family vacations<\/li>\n<li>babysitting<\/li>\n<li>work during school hours<\/li>\n<li>hunting, fishing, oversleeping, missing the bus, etc.<\/li>\n<li>no parent\/guardian written note for an otherwise excusable absence<\/li>\n<li>accompanying a parent\/guardian on an appointment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When a student has a planned unexcused absence of 11 or more consecutive school days, parents must fill out and submit an Individualized Home Instruction Plan (IHIP) to the Office of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment.<\/p>\n<p>Administrative procedures ensure that student attendance is monitored on a regular basis; that there are systems in place to acknowledge a student\u2019s efforts to maintain or improve school attendance; and that there are means to monitor and communicate attendance records with parents\/guardians and agencies, as appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes and are held accountable for work missed due to absence, whether the absence is excused or unexcused. If a student is truant, appropriate consequences will be imposed. Attendance is taken daily in grades K-12.<\/p>\n<p>Continuous monitoring will be conducted to identify students who are absent, tardy, or leave class or school early. A student will be considered chronically absent if they miss ten percent of enrolled days in school.\u00a0 If a pattern of attendance concerns for an individual student is identified a designated staff person(s) will follow-up in accordance with Policy 5100 Student Attendance.<\/p>\n<h3>Other Attendance Information for Elementary Schools<\/h3>\n<p>High absenteeism for any reason interferes with academic progress. After an absence, each student returning to school will present a written excuse from the parent or guardian. If an excuse is not received when a student returns to school, the attendance clerk will contact the parent\/guardian and request either a written and\/or digital excuse for the absence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If a child arrives late to school, a parent\/guardian must escort the child into the Main Office to sign them in.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Attendance Incentives, Sanctions and Interventions<\/h3>\n<p>The district will design and implement systems to acknowledge a student\u2019s efforts to maintain or improve school attendance. This includes, but is not limited to, the following actions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>At all grade levels, improving the school climate through student feedback in order to provide a safe, supportive school environment and engage students in school.<\/li>\n<li>At all grade levels, actively engaging students, and families in school, determining systematic barriers to school attendance, and developing solutions to remove those barriers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<h2>Automatic External Defibrillators (AED)<\/h2>\n<p>The Saratoga Springs City School District maintains on site, in each instructional school facility and at the district office, at least one functional automated external defibrillator (AED) for use during emergencies.\u00a0 Whenever public school facilities are used for school-sponsored or school-approved curricular or extracurricular events or activities or a school-sponsored athletic contest is held at any location, school administrators shall ensure the presence of at least one staff person who is trained in the operation and use of an AED.\u00a0 Where a school-sponsored competitive athletic event is held at a site other than a public-school facility, the public-school officials must assure that AED equipment is provided on-site.<\/p>\n<h2>Biking to School Caroline, Division, Geyser, Lake)<\/h2>\n<p>It has been determined that currently there is a safe access point for your child to ride a bicycle onto four of our school properties (Caroline, Division, Geyser, and Lake).<\/p>\n<p>Below, please find some basic requirements (additional building-specific requirements may apply\u2014contact the building principal for details) that must be adhered to for your child to receive permission from the building principal to ride a bicycle to and from our school.<\/p>\n<p>They are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both you and your child must review and sign the Bicycle Safety Agreement.<\/li>\n<li>You must complete a form so that your child\u2019s bicycle is registered in the main office.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please be advised that should your child fail to adhere to the requirements contained in the Bicycle Safety Agreement, your child may lose the privilege of riding their bicycle to and from school.<\/p>\n<p>Please refer to the Board of Education Policy 5453-Biking to School and the Administrative Regulation 5453-R for more information and the Bicycle Safety Agreement.

Any questions or clarifications may be requested from the school district and building administrators.<\/p>\n<p><em>*Explained in extensive detail in the full document.<\/em><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Concerts<\/h2>\n<p>Students performing in concerts should arrive at school at the predetermined time as shared by their teacher. They are to report directly to the supervised area and remain there until called on to perform. Parents are asked to remain seated throughout the concert and not to leave after their child has performed. This is asked out of respect for the students performing during later stages of the concert.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unless an emergency is imminent, parents will not be allowed to take their child from a supervised classroom until the concert is completely over.<\/strong> There will be no exceptions to this procedure as it is outlined above.<\/p>\n<p>Parents must also keep their other children with them throughout the concert sitting in the seats provided. It is expected the audience is quiet during the performance, as the teachers and students work hard to prepare for concerts and performances, and respect should be given to them throughout the concert.<\/p>\n<h2>Custody<\/h2>\n<p>If custody of a child is limited by court order, a signed copy of that order must be on file at the school. Without a signed court order either parent may request to see a teacher, be contacted in the event of an emergency, view school records or sign a child out of school. <em>If custody papers have been updated, it is imperative to provide the school with a copy of the most recent court order. Parents should make sure the court papers on file are the most recent and that rulings listed are current.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Digital Tools<\/h2>\n<p>We are excited to support our teachers as they build their own \u201cDigital Toolbox\u201d to meet the home\/school communication needs as well as remote learning needs of students and the families with whom they work.<\/p>\n<p>The Saratoga Springs City School District will continue to use digital connectivity and technology to support individualized instruction and student-centered learning.<\/p>\n<p>For students, these could include resources such as Seesaw (K-5 Assignment and Portfolio tool), and Canvas (6-8), Microsoft Office 365, cloud-based learning tools, blended learning, digital collaboration, and project-based learning. All resources support real world connections, and student choice in demonstrating understanding. Teachers may choose to use many district-supported digital tools such as Canva, Nearpod, WeVideo , Library databases, as well as many other products.<\/p>\n<h2>Dignity for All Students Act (DASA)<\/h2>\n<p>The Dignity for All Students Act (DASA) was enacted effective July 1, 2012. The purpose of DASA is to afford all public-school students an environment free of discrimination and harassment.\u00a0 DASA prohibits harassment of students by employees and fellow students.<\/p>\n<p>Bullying is defined as an intentional act of aggression based on an imbalance of power that is meant to harm a victim either physically or psychologically. This usually occurs repeatedly over time but could be a single serious event. DASA incidents may happen in school, at school events, or off campus if it involves cyberbullying or an event that affects the victim\u2019s ability to attend school and fully take part in our academic and extracurricular programs.<\/p>\n<p>Incidents of bullying or cyberbullying may be pursued through informal intervention and mediation or through the filing of a formal complaint. All conversations are kept confidential to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Students and parents\/guardians are encouraged to report bullying incidents to a staff member. This could be a teacher, administrator, school psychologist or school counselor.<\/p>\n<p>The DASA coordinator for the building is the principal.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The District DASA Coordinator is Dr. Joseph Greco, the Director of Personnel Development, who can be reached at\u00a0 <a href=\"mailto:j_greco@saratogaschools.org\">j_greco@saratogaschools.org<\/a> or by phone at 518-583-4713.

The building will follow your \u201cAnnual Parent\/Guardian Authorization Form\u201d that parents\/guardians submit online at the beginning of the school year for the emergency closing plan of action for your children.<\/p>\n<p>Weather cancellations and delays are posted on the school website, right on the homepage. The District will also send a ParentSquare email and SMS text message to families. The decision to close or delay the starting time of school will be made as early as possible.<\/p>\n<p>School closings are also announced through the media via the School Closing Network (which includes many local TV and radio stations as well as newspaper websites).<\/p>\n<p>Parents\/guardians are urged to check the website or news stations for the announcements rather than call the school district.<\/p>\n<h2>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)<\/h2>\n<p>This is to advise you of your rights with respect to student records pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of student records. The law gives parents\/guardians and students over 18 years of age (referred to in the law as \u201celigible students\u201d) the following rights:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The right to inspect and review the student\u2019s education records within 45 days of the day the district receives a request for access. Parents\/guardians or eligible students should submit to the Building Principal a written request that identifies the records they wish to inspect. The Principal will plan for access and notify the parent \/guardian or eligible student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.<\/li>\n<li>The right to request the amendment of the student\u2019s education records that the parent\/guardian or eligible student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Parents\/guardians or eligible students may ask the district to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading by writing the Principal, clearly identifying the part of the record they want changed and specifying why it is inaccurate or misleading. Please note that the amendment procedure may not be used to challenge a grade, an opinion, or a substantive decision made by the school district about a student.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If the district decides not to amend the record as requested by the parent\/guardian or eligible student, the district will notify the parent\/guardian or eligible student of the decision and advise them of their right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the parent\/guardian or eligible student when notified of the right to a hearing.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student\u2019s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. There is an exception to FERPA\u2019s prohibition against non-consensual disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, pursuant to which the district may disclose personally identifiable information from education records without consent.\n<p>One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to \u201cschool officials\u201d with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the district as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel); a person serving on the school board; a person or company with whom the district has contracted to perform a special task (such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist); or a parent\/guardian or student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.\u00a0 With respect to what constitutes a \u2018legitimate education interest\u2019, it is generally accepted that a school official generally has a legitimate education interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill their professional responsibility.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A student or parent\/guardian who believes there has been a violation of the provisions of FERPA may file a complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20202-5920. Complaints must contain specific allegations of fact giving reasonable cause to believe that a violation of FERPA has occurred. More information regarding the complaint process is available at the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s website at <a href=\"https:\/\/studentprivacy.ed.gov\/ferpa\">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Notification<\/h3>\n<p>The Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act\u00a0(FERPA) generally protects \u201cstudent records\u201d from disclosure.<\/p>\n<p>However, FERPA allows schools to disclose, without parental\/guardian consent, certain \u201cdirectory information\u201d such as a student\u2019s name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, participation in athletics, honors, awards, and\u00a0photographs, unless parents\/guardians have advised the district to the contrary.<\/p>\n<p>The primary purpose of the &#8220;directory information&#8221; exception to FERPA is to allow Saratoga Springs City School District (SSCSD) to include this type of information in school publications such as newsletters, calendars, the school district website, ParentSquare, and social media outlets. \u00a0In addition, it allows for the publicity of student accomplishments or specific educational programs to the electronic (television) and print (newspaper) media.<\/p>\n<p>SSCSD has\u00a0designated\u00a0and\u00a0historically released the following directory information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Student&#8217;s name<\/li>\n<li>Address<\/li>\n<li>Telephone listing<\/li>\n<li>Electronic mail address<\/li>\n<li>Photograph<\/li>\n<li>Date and place of birth<\/li>\n<li>Major field of study<\/li>\n<li>Dates of attendance<\/li>\n<li>Grade level<\/li>\n<li>Participation in officially recognized activities and sports<\/li>\n<li>Weight and height of members of athletic teams<\/li>\n<li>Degrees, honors, and awards received<\/li>\n<li>The most recent educational agency or institution attendance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Parents not wishing directory information about their child to be used in either district publications, released to the media or on the district website must fill out the <a href=\"https:\/\/forms.office.com\/r\/ZReH9NNz0D\">FERPA opt-out form<\/a><span>.<\/span> This form must be filed annually in September.<\/p>\n<h2>Gun\/Weapon Free Schools Policy<\/h2>\n<p>It is important for all members of the public to understand that it is illegal for any firearm or weapon to be brought onto school property by an individual other than a peace officer or law enforcement official in the discharge of legal duties. The Saratoga Springs City School District Board of Education may grant permission for individuals that have been designated by the District to carry a firearm while performing his or her duties while on campus. According to the Gun Free Schools Act, starter pistols, explosives, other weapons able to expel a projectile, even portions of a workable weapon, are all covered under this legislation. This information is extremely important, not only for students who could suffer severe penalties of up to one-year removal from school, as well as mandatory referral to law enforcement or juvenile delinquency officials for prosecution, but also for parents\/guardians and community members who might also face legal prosecution for violating this Act.<\/p>\n<p>The full impact of this legislation makes it illegal for someone to drive onto school property with a firearm or similarly defined weapon in their possession or in their vehicle.\u00a0 In accordance with a weapon being on the school grounds, this gun free school zone law applies to within 1000 ft. of the school building. Additionally, this law applies not only to \u201cthe school district property\u201d, but also applies to all school events held on or off campus. This means a parent\/guardian returning from a day of hunting should not have the rifle or shotgun in their vehicle if they come to school to pick up their child or attend an evening meeting. Beyond strict compliance with the law, there is also the concern for the potential of some unintended tragedy whenever firearms are brought in close contact with large numbers of people, including children. \u00a0Please use particular caution in the fall when so many citizens may be involved in hunting or target shooting activities.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Harassment<\/h2>\n<p>It is the policy of the Saratoga Springs City School District that harassment and discrimination based upon actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other legally protected category is unacceptable conduct and will not be tolerated. This is in keeping with efforts to establish an environment in which the dignity and worth of each member of the school community is respected. The goal of the district is to provide a community in which all students and staff are accepted as individuals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Harassment<\/strong> of any member of the school community by an individual is prohibited on school property or in connection with school-related activities.<\/p>\n<h3>Complaint Processing<\/h3>\n<p>The District will promptly and thoroughly investigate all complaints of discrimination and\/or harassment whether verbal or written, formal or informal. Students and parents\/guardians should report such incidents to the student\u2019s teacher, building psychologist, or building administrator.<\/p>\n<h2>Health Services<\/h2>\n<h3>First Aid and Parent Notification in Case of Accidents or Illness<\/h3>\n<p>School nurses will provide immediate medical care to an injured or sick person but may not go beyond their legal duties to apply second dressings or care for injuries that occurred at home or elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important that the school nurse be able to contact the parent(s)\/ guardian(s) of a child in case of sudden illness or accident.\u00a0 Emergency information forms will be provided to parent(s)\/guardian(s) for each child enrolled in school. Parent(s)\/guardian(s) are to provide the following information:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Home telephone number<\/li>\n<li>Business telephone number(s) of parent(s)\/guardian(s)<\/li>\n<li>Name and telephone number of a friend, relative, or neighbor (who has given consent) to act for the parent(s)\/guardian(s) in case of an emergency<\/li>\n<li>Name and telephone number of the family physician and preferred hospital<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><em>**The school MUST be notified promptly of any change in this information. **<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If a student needs to go home due to an illness or injury, the school nurse will contact the parent(s)\/guardian(s). Parent(s)\/guardian(s) are responsible, whenever possible, to transport their ill or injured child.<\/p>\n<p>Parent(s)\/guardian(s) are responsible also for subsequent care and treatment. If an injury occurs on school property and the child requires medical care, an accident report will be filed. However, school insurance is secondary to the parent(s)\u2019\/ guardian(s)\u2019 insurance.<\/p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0 A child will NOT be released to any person other than a parent\/guardian without authorization by a parent\/guardian.<\/p>\n<h3>Health Awareness List<\/h3>\n<p>A Medical Alert List of students who have health problems is maintained by the nurse and used to make essential staff aware of students with medical conditions. This list is updated throughout the year. Please inform the Health Office of any changes in your child\u2019s health. The school nurse is always available to work with you or help with any health problems.<\/p>\n<h3>Illness<\/h3>\n<p>If a child has signs or symptoms of illness, such as a fever, sore throat, or upset stomach, etc., the child should not be sent to school. In addition, the child must be free of vomiting, diarrhea, and fever free without medication for 24 hours before returning to school. Any child diagnosed with Strep Throat or Conjunctivitis (pink eye) must be on antibiotics for 24 hours before returning to school. This is for the child\u2019s protection, as well as protection for classmates.<\/p>\n<p>If a child is absent, the attendance clerk should be notified. To control communicable diseases, it is important the school nurse be notified of strep throat, scarlet fever, fifth disease, chickenpox, impetigo, head lice, scabies, pinworms, and any other communicable diseases.<\/p>\n<h3>New York State Immunization Requirements<\/h3>\n<p>Please use the following link to view New York State immunization requirements for students:\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.ny.gov\/publications\/2370_2026.pdf\">https:\/\/www.health.ny.gov\/publications\/2370_2026.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It is the responsibility of the parent(s)\/guardian(s) to provide this information.

Homework is a continuation of a learning process developed in the classroom and carried on by the child in the home environment.\u00a0 Its effectiveness depends upon careful planning by the teacher as well as supportive parental\/guardian involvement.<\/p>\n<p>Research has clearly shown that homework has different purposes at different grade levels. Homework for younger students develops positive attitudes and work habits while homework for older students develops or expands content and knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>The School District acknowledges the importance of current research in developing and implementing homework guidelines that will maximize the effectiveness of homework as a strategy to improve student performance. The following time frames are suggested by research when assigning total daily homework:<\/p>\n<p>Grades K \u2013 2: 10 \u2013 20 Minutes <br \/>\nGrades 3 \u2013 5: 30 \u2013 50 Minutes<\/p>\n<h2>Homework Requests<\/h2>\n<p>Homework requests for an absent student should be made prior to 10:30 AM. This will give the teachers time to prepare the materials to be sent home. You may pick up assignments and materials in the Main Office at the end of the day.<\/p>\n<h2>Kindergarten Registration and Screening<\/h2>\n<p>Kindergarten Registration will begin in January.

This allows the district to provide free meals to all students in the district. Each student receives one meal per day per program (E.G., BREAKFAST, LUNCH). If students wish to purchase additional meals of other food items, they must pay for those items at the time of the sale. The district does not permit charging to accounts for such \u201ca la carte\u201d items if students do not have funds available.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>No student with unpaid charges will be prohibited from purchasing food if they have money that day. If school food authorities (SFAs) suspect that a student may be abusing this policy, written notice will be provided to the parent\/guardian.<\/p>\n<p>Students who cannot pay for a meal or who have unpaid meal debt shall not be publicly identified or stigmatized (including wristbands or hand stamps), required to do chores or work to pay for meals, or have meals thrown away after they have been served. District staff shall not discuss a student&#8217;s unpaid meal debt in front of other students. The district shall not take any action directed at a student to collect unpaid school meal fees.<\/p>\n<p>The district&#8217;s payment system allows for automatic replenishment when a balance reaches a certain amount set by the parent\/guardian, The district shall encourage parents\/guardians to utilize this option.<\/p>\n<p>Parents\/guardians shall be discreetly notified of student account balances regularly. This notification will continue regularly until the account is replenished, Parents\/guardians must repay all unpaid charges remaining at the end of the year or before their child leaves the district, whichever occurs first.<\/p>\n<p>The school district shall notify all parents\/guardians in writing on an annual basis at the start of the school year and to families transferring during the year, outlining the requirements of this policy. The policy shall also be published in appropriate school and district publications. All staff involved in implementing and enforcing this policy shall also be notified of these requirements and their responsibilities.<\/p>\n<p>Unpaid meal charges are a financial burden to the district and taxpayers and can negatively affect the school program. Unpaid meal charges shall be considered &#8220;delinquent&#8221; as per the district&#8217;s accounting practices. The district shall attempt to recover unpaid meal charges before the end of the school year but may continue efforts into the next school year. The district shall notify parents\/guardians of unpaid meal charges at regular intervals, and may engage in collection activities by district staff, which do not involve debt collectors as defined in federal law (15 USC {1692a) and may not charge fees or interest or file a lawsuit against students&#8217; parents or guardians. The district shall offer repayment plans and may take other actions that do not result in harm or shame to the child, until unpaid charges are paid.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The remaining funds may be carried over to the next school year. When students leave the district or graduate, the district will attempt to contact the parent\/guardian to return the remaining funds. Parents\/guardians may request that funds be transferred to other students (e.g., siblings, unpaid accounts). All transfer requests must be in writing. Unclaimed funds remaining after 6 years shall be absorbed by the school meal account.<\/p>\n<p>Building Principals, working with the head of food services, shall ensure that all district and food service staff with responsibilities under this policy will be trained on the provisions of this policy and the requirements of Education Law section 908.

Creativeness and originality will be stressed throughout the year. Smocks are needed, especially for the younger grades. An old shirt or blouse is ideal.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\">Health Education<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The purpose of the Saratoga Springs City School District Health Education is to prepare students in grades kindergarten through fifth grade with the knowledge, skills, and ability to make informed choices regarding their health, safety, and well-being as they grow to be mature, responsible, successful adults.<\/p>\n<p>Health Education provides students with the skills and knowledge to make informed and appropriate decisions regarding the rights and responsibilities of their own bodies. Child abuse prevention is an integral aspect of our program. Students learn how to recognize, refuse, resist, and report potentially abusive situations.<\/p>\n<p>The development of self-esteem, respect for self and others, love, understanding, and decision-making skills, are all important aspects of social, emotional, and interpersonal growth. The program provides knowledge related to human growth, development and reproduction in a way that fosters a healthy attitude toward human sexuality as an integral part of one\u2019s total well-being.<\/p>\n<h3>Library<\/h3>\n<p>Our schools are fortunate to have an outstanding library housing thousands of books, magazines, videos and more. We have a certified Library Media Specialist present in the library throughout the week.

Adaptive physical education is provided for students with special needs, based on recommendations by a physician and\/or the Committee on Special Education. A special form will be provided by the school for completion by the physician.<\/p>\n<h2>Support Services<\/h2>\n<h3>Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS)<\/h3>\n<p>MTSS stands for Multi-Tiered System of Supports. It is a framework we use to provide targeted support to all students.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>MTSS is designed to help schools identify struggling students early and intervene quickly. It focuses on the \u201cwhole child\u201d. That means it supports academic growth, but many other areas, too. These include behavior, social and emotional needs, and absenteeism (not attending school).<\/p>\n<p>The tiers of support are a critical part of MTSS. They get more intense from one level to the next. For example, a child receiving small group interventions may need to \u201cmove\u201d to one-on-one help.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If you have a concern about your child\u2019s progress in school, please contact your child\u2019s teacher and\/or your building principal.<\/p>\n<p>The Saratoga Springs City School District strives for every student to experience a personal connection to learning which will serve them for a lifetime. We are fortunate to be able to provide a multi-tiered system of supports called Response to Intervention (RtI).<\/p>\n<p>RtI is a framework for providing high-quality curriculum and instruction to all students and intervention support to some students based on assessments, including the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Universal Screening\/Diagnostic Assessments<\/li>\n<li>Progress Monitoring<\/li>\n<li>Curriculum-based Assessments<\/li>\n<li>State Assessments<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Response to Intervention (RtI)<\/h3>\n<p>The Saratoga Springs City School District strives for every student to experience a personal connection to learning which will serve them for a lifetime.

It may be differentiated to meet different abilities. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Intervention<\/strong>\u2014Tier 2 is supplemental instruction that supports core instruction. It is focused on specific student needs. This is provided by appropriate, qualified staff, which may include classroom teacher, specialist, or other staff in a variety of settings. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Remediation<\/strong>\u2014Tier 3 is more intensive instruction in addition to core instruction. It is intended for students who have significant gaps in essential skills.

The bus driver will remind students of this requirement if they fail to use their card.<\/li>\n<li>If a student repetitively fails to scan their card when entering\/exiting the bus, or consistently loses their card, drivers may submit written discipline referrals.<\/li>\n<li>If a student has not received an RFID Card, they should let their building principal know immediately so they order one for the student.\u00a0 All initial cards are free of charge.\u00a0 For lost or missing RFID cards, parents and\/or <strong>students will need to order a replacement card on the districts website by going \u201cFamily Links &amp; Resources\u201d and then scrolling down to \u201cStudent ID Replacement\u201d. <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Reporting School Bus Incidents\/Concerns:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>If the incident\/concern specifically relates to the bus driver or bus driver assistant, please call the Transportation Department at 518-587-4545 option 0 (inform receptionist) as they will complete an intake form at the initial phone call.<\/li>\n<li>If the incident\/concern is student discipline related and on the school bus:\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li>The first step is to inform the driver, who will take the appropriate steps to address the concern.<\/li>\n<li>If this does not resolve the problem, inform your building administrator.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>If the concern involves bus routing or bus stops, please email the Transportation Routing Office at <a href=\"mailto:routing@saratogaschools.org\">routing@saratogaschools.org<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Any other bus concerns may be directed to the Bus Dispatch Office at 518-587-4545. option 1.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Bus Behavior Expectations<\/h3>\n<p>Students should always conduct themselves in a manner consistent with established standards for classroom behavior in accordance with the Code of Conduct.<\/p>\n<p>Inappropriate student behavior can cause the driver to become distracted, which can increase the chances of the bus being involved in an accident.<\/p>\n<p>The following \u201c<em><strong>Bus Behavior Expectations<\/strong><\/em>\u201d are posted in each school bus:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible<\/li>\n<li>Follow driver instructions the first time<\/li>\n<li>Always remain seated in your assigned seat<\/li>\n<li>Keep aisle, windows &amp; emergency exits clear<\/li>\n<li>Always use an inside voice.

Transportation conferences may also be utilized for students accumulating 10 bus referrals and 20 days of bus suspension during a school year.<\/p>\n<h3>PM Drop-Off Procedure for Kindergarten Students<\/h3>\n<p>School district regulations require that a parent\/guardian or another responsible person be available at the bus stop in the afternoon to meet kindergarteners and Head Start students. Due to safety concerns, these children will not be dropped off unless a designated person is available. Parents\/guardians will be contacted to pick up the child. Responsible individuals include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Parents or guardians<\/li>\n<li>Older siblings<\/li>\n<li>Other designated persons with prior written approval from parent or guardian<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Transportation Changes<\/h3>\n<p>Student transportation is scheduled to and from the student&#8217;s primary residence. If transportation is needed to a different location on a regular basis for daycare or joint custody purposes, the parent\/guardian must complete a Transportation Change Form.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Transportation Change Forms must be renewed on a yearly basis by June 1 <sup>St<\/sup> for the following school year. Forms received after August 15<em><sup>th<\/sup><\/em> will not be processed until after the first week of school. For changes during the school year, submit forms as soon as possible.<\/li>\n<li>Only students in grades K \u2013 8 are eligible for transportation changes for daycare purposes.<\/li>\n<li>Transportation is available to accredited daycare centers within the school district boundaries. If your elementary school children will be attending private or home-based daycare, that location must be within the boundaries of the elementary school in which they attend.<\/li>\n<li>Requests will be approved on an annual basis if seating is available on established bus routes. Additional buses will not be added to accommodate transportation change requests.<\/li>\n<li>Students are not allowed to ride a different bus for social functions, jobs (including babysitting), scouting, religious activities or any other non-approved activity as determined by the building principal.<\/li>\n<li>Students who are not eligible for transportation are not permitted to ride home with a friend for an afterschool activity.<\/li>\n<li>In the event of an emergency and your child needs to ride a different bus or get off at a different stop on the same bus, please send a note to the school with your child. The note must then be approved by the school office. If an emergency occurs during the day, please contact your child\u2019s school office as soon as possible to arrange for alternate transportation.<\/li>\n<li>Transportation Change Requests: Parent\/guardian completes and submits the electronic \u201cTransportation Change Request\u201d form on the school district website. Assistance with this process can also be found at the Transportation Department, the Registrar\u2019s office or each of the district\u2019s six elementary school offices.\u00a0 Upon receiving an approval\/denial from the transportation department, the transportation department notifies the parent\/guardian of the decision. Elementary Schools are also notified by the transportation department and are provided updated bus schedule information. Requests received after August 15<sup>th<\/sup> may not be honored until after school begins.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Bus Schedule Information<\/h3>\n<p>The My Ride K-12 mobile app and website provides secure access to \u201creal time\u201d student transportation information, student ID card scans, current bus location and estimated arrival time at the bus stop. Instructions to access My Ride K-12 can be found on the Transportation Webpage on the district website.<\/p>\n<p>Students should be at their bus stop <em>5 <\/em>minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive in the morning.<\/p>\n<p>If you have bus routing questions, please email the routing office at routing@saratogaschools.org.<\/p>\n<h3>Assigned Seating on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>The school district reserves the right to assign student seating on school buses for safety, efficiency, and disciplinary reasons. In addition, assigned seating is required on all elementary buses and may be assigned on middle and high school buses if needed for behavioral issues. Drivers should have assigned seats in place by early October after considering grade level, compatibility, behaviors, siblings, friends etc. Assigned seats are also subject to change at any time during the school year.<\/p>\n<h3>Dangerous Substances<\/h3>\n<p>D.O.T. regulations prohibit aerosol cans, glass containers and flammable substances inside the passenger compartment of school buses. Therefore, students shall not carry these items on school buses at any time. Perfumes and colognes shall not be discharged on school buses because they can cause an adverse allergic reaction with some individuals.<\/p>\n<h3>Food and Beverages on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>New York State Education Department regulations prohibit eating or drinking on the bus. The reason for this regulation is due to the danger of a child choking when eating on a school bus and due to students, who have food allergies. So, please remember, no eating or drinking on the bus at any time.<\/p>\n<h3>Transporting Large Items on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>For the safety of all occupants being transported on district school buses, the following guidelines have been established to provide information on the size of items that students may transport on school buses.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Objects smaller than 36 inches (length) by 12 inches (width) by 8 inches (depth) can be transported on school buses.

Therefore, the following guidelines are provided in accordance with the district&#8217;s Code of Conduct policy.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cell phones and other electronic communication devices shall not be used to bully, discriminate, threaten, harass, or denigrate other students or school personnel.<\/li>\n<li>Devices may not be used while boarding\/discharging or crossing, and during emergency situations or school bus safety drills unless authorized by the driver.<\/li>\n<li>Video\/audio recordings and pictures are not allowed to be taken by students riding District buses.<\/li>\n<li>Laser pointers and other objects that can obstruct or impair the vision of the driver are not allowed to be used on school buses at any time.<\/li>\n<li>iPods, tablets, or other similar electronic devices may be used on school buses only if equipped with headphones and the volume is maintained at a level that does not disrupt the driver or other students.<\/li>\n<li>Headphones must be used when listening to music, playing games or viewing content on devices. For student safety reasons headphones must be removed when entering\/exiting the bus or crossing at bus stops.<\/li>\n<li>Any devices that are being used inappropriately may be confiscated by bus drivers and returned to the students when they depart the bus. If a student continues to use their device inappropriately, a discipline referral may be submitted, and the device may be confiscated and returned only to a parent\/guardian.<\/li>\n<li>The school District will not be held responsible for the loss or theft of any personal electronic device.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Failure to follow these and any bus rules may result in disciplinary action in accordance with the Code of Conduct.<\/p>\n<h2>Visitors To The School<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">No students will leave school unless they are signed-out in the office as per school procedures.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Teachers are not expected to discuss individual matters with visitors during class time\/activities.<\/li>\n<li>Any visitor must get administrative permission to meet with a student during the school day or at school sponsored events.<\/li>\n<li>Visitors attending school functions outside the school day that are open to the public, such as HSA, PTA, PTSO meetings or public gatherings, are not required to sign-in at the Main Office.<\/li>\n<li>Unauthorized persons may be asked to leave, and police may be called if the situation warrants.<\/li>\n<li>Visitors are expected to sign-in at the Main Office upon arriving at the school, and to sign-out when leaving.<\/li>\n<li>Parents\/guardians are not permitted to walk their child to the classroom unless pre-approved permission has been given by the principal and teacher.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Volunteers<\/h2>\n<p>The Board of Education of the Saratoga Springs City School District recognizes that community involvement is an important component of the District\u2019s mission, and essential to the success of its academic and extracurricular programs.
