Please contact your school counselor to investigate whether this is an option for your schedule.<\/p>\n<h3>Dropping a Course Not Required for Graduation<\/h3>\n<p>Students should make every effort to maintain a rigorous academic schedule. This includes maintaining a schedule with the minimum credits required at every grade level. Students are expected to take the courses they requested. Courses required for graduation will not be permitted to be dropped. For a student to replace an elective course with a study hall, the required paperwork must be completed no later than the end of the second quarter for a full year course or the end of the first quarter\/third quarter for a semester course. Only in extenuating circumstances, and with administrator approval, may a student drop after the deadline and\/or drop below the number of credits required by grade level. If a student is permitted to drop a course after the deadline, the course grade will indicate WF \u2013 Withdrawal Failing or WP \u2013 Withdrawal Passing on the official transcripts. This indication will not be calculated into the student\u2019s final average.<\/p>\n<h3>Course Level Changes<\/h3>\n<p>In some of our academic disciplines, multiple levels of instruction have been established to meet the needs of our diverse student population.\u00a0 Early and frequent communication with the classroom teacher is essential in making educated decisions regarding level changes.\u00a0 Two important factors to consider are the student\u2019s previous academic achievement, along with historic and current effort levels.\u00a0 Attending extra help regularly and completing all assignments allows the students, Parents, school counselor and teacher to collectively help make an informed decision.\u00a0 Students may change course levels as long as seats are available, and the required paperwork is signed and approved by the student, Parent, counselor, teacher and department head no later than one week after the first quarter ends.<\/p>\n<p>After the first quarter deadline, and in extenuating circumstances approved by administration, a student may be permitted to change course levels after the deadline.\u00a0 In this case, the original course will stay on the official transcript with a grade indicated by WF \u2013 Withdrawal Failing or WP \u2013 Withdrawal Passing.\u00a0 This grade will not be calculated into the student\u2019s final average.<\/p>\n<h3>Saratoga Springs High School Grading Philosophy\u00a0<\/h3>\n<p>The Saratoga Springs High School Grading Philosophy was developed through the collaborative efforts of the Building Equity Leadership Team, with representation of all stakeholder groups in our school community. Its purpose is to guide reflections and discussions in grading practices.\u00a0 Feedback plays a critical role in learning. Best practices in giving feedback\/grades:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a realistic assessment and understanding of the individual student\u2019s progress related to the essential skills and standards of the course.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Provide students with constructive, timely, specific, and frequent feedback.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Establish practices that allow for the development of self-reliant and intrinsically motivated learners.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Establish consistent criteria for grading in each course, independent of which instructor teaches the class.\u00a0<\/li>\n<li>Consider evidence of student learning when determining final grades.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Grades will reflect demonstrated student learning and understanding. Grades or extra credit will not be awarded for activities or actions that do not directly relate to learning.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"ReportCards\"><\/a>Report Cards<\/h2>\n<p>Parents should note that report cards are available online through SchoolTool and are sent home digitally through ParentSquare.\u00a0 Please refer to the section regarding \u201cTechnology\u201d for directions on how to access SchoolTool.<\/p>\n<h3>5-Week Interim\/Quarterly Reports<\/h3>\n<p><span>These reports are available only on SchoolTool.

The attendance policy is built on the belief that regular attendance increases student achievement, reduces drop-out levels and develops positive attitudes toward school and learning.<\/p>\n<p>Parents are required to provide a written excuse within a two-week period of the absence (ten school days), indicating the reasons for any absence, tardiness, or leaving school early. Parents are asked to call the attendance office of the school whenever a child is going to be absent. \u00a0Parents are contacted by the attendance office if a child is absent and the school has not received prior notice by the Parent.<\/p>\n<p>Excused ATEDS are defined as absences, tardiness, and early departure from class or school due to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>personal illness<\/li>\n<li>serious illness or death in the family<\/li>\n<li>religious observance or education during school hours with a signed written request<\/li>\n<li>required court appearances of the student<\/li>\n<li>required medical appointments of the student<\/li>\n<li>approved college visits of the student<\/li>\n<li>military obligations of the student<\/li>\n<li>school sponsored activities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At the discretion of the Superintendent, a student may be granted a maximum number of excused absences so that the student has the opportunity to spend time with their Parent or legal guardian who is about to be deployed, returning for a mid-deployment break or being discharged from military service.<\/p>\n<p>All other absences, tardies and early dismissal are considered unexcused and illegal.

In unique situations, reasonable physical force may be used to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect oneself, or any person from physical injury<\/li>\n<li>Protect the property of the school or others<\/li>\n<li>Restrain or remove a student whose behavior interferes with safety and orderly operation of the school, if the student has refused to refrain from further disruptive acts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Students who are found to have violated the District\u2019s Code of Conduct may be subject to the following consequences, either alone or in combination.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Potential Disciplinary Consequences <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oral and written warnings<\/li>\n<li>Written notification to Parents<\/li>\n<li>Detention (except at elementary)<\/li>\n<li>Suspension from transportation<\/li>\n<li>Suspension from social\/extra-curricular activities<\/li>\n<li>Suspension from athletic participation<\/li>\n<li>Suspension of other privileges<\/li>\n<li>In-school suspension, or similar as designated by an administrator<\/li>\n<li>Removal from class &#8211; A teacher may remove a student from the classroom due to inappropriate behavior, and follow-up with Principal or designee<\/li>\n<li>Short- or long-term suspension from school<\/li>\n<li>Permanent suspension from school<strong style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>DISCIPLINE OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This code of conduct affords students with disabilities certain procedural protections whenever school authorities intend to impose discipline upon them. These procedures are consistent with the safeguards required by applicable laws and regulations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STUDENT SEARCHES AND INTERROGATIONS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Any school official authorized to impose a disciplinary consequence on a student may question a student about an alleged violation of law or the District Code of Conduct. School officials are not required to contact a student&#8217;s Parent before questioning the student.<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In addition, the Board of Education authorizes the Superintendent or their designee, Building Principals or their designee, the school nurse and District security officials to conduct searches of students, their vehicles, and their belongings if the authorized school official has reasonable suspicion to believe that the search will result in evidence that the student violated the law or the District Code of Conduct.\u00a0 The search may include conducting a field test.<\/p>\n<p><strong>VISITORS TO THE SCHOOLS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Building Principal or their designee is responsible for all persons in the building and on the grounds. For these reasons, the following rules apply to visitors to the schools:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\">\n<li>Anyone who is not a regular staff member or a student at the school will be considered a visitor.<\/li>\n<li>All employees in school buildings will wear their SSCSD ID badges.<\/li>\n<li>All visitors to the school must report to the main office or designated area upon arrival at the school. All visitors must present a photo identification which will be screened by our visitor management system.\u00a0\u00a0 Each visitor will be required to sign the visitor\u2019s register and will be issued a visitor\u2019s identification badge, which must be worn at all times while in the school or on school grounds.\u00a0 The visitor must sign out at the main office or designated area before leaving the building.<\/li>\n<li>Visitors attending school functions that are open to the public, such as parent-teacher organization meetings or public gatherings, are not required to register, but are required to remain in the location of the activity.<\/li>\n<li>Parents or citizens who wish to visit a classroom while school is in session are required to arrange such visits in advance with the classroom teacher(s) and will be permitted at the discretion of the Building Principal or designee in order to keep class disruption to a minimum.<\/li>\n<li>Teachers are not expected to take class time to discuss individual matters with visitors.<\/li>\n<li>Any unauthorized person on school property will be reported to the Principal or their designee.

It is reviewed and updated as necessary each year. The complete Code of Conduct, Board of Education Policy 5300, which has been approved by the Saratoga Springs City School District Board of Education, is available online and in every school building for Parent and community review. Any questions or clarifications may be requested from District and Building Administrators.\u00a0 The complete Code of Conduct can be accessed on the District\u2019s website (www.saratogaschools.org).\u00a0 A link to a translation tool is also available on our website.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"GunWeaponFreeSchools\"><\/a>Gun\/Weapon Free Schools Policy<\/h2>\n<p>It is important for all members of the public to understand that it is illegal for any firearm or weapon to be brought onto school property by an individual other than a peace officer or law enforcement official in the discharge of legal duties.\u00a0 The Saratoga Springs City School District Board of Education may grant permission for individuals that have been designated by the district to carry a firearm while performing his or her duties while on campus. According to the Gun Free Schools Act, starter pistols, explosives, other weapons able to expel a projectile, even portions of a workable weapon, are all covered under this legislation.\u00a0 This information is extremely important, not only for students who could suffer severe penalties of up to one-year removal from school, as well as mandatory referral to law enforcement or juvenile delinquency officials for prosecution, but also for Parent and community members who might also face legal prosecution for violating this Act.<\/p>\n<p>The full impact of this legislation makes it illegal for someone to drive onto school property with a firearm or similarly defined weapon in their possession or in their vehicle.\u00a0 In accordance to a weapon being on the school grounds, this gun free school zone law applies to within 1000 ft. of the school building. Additionally, this law applies to not only \u201cthe school district property\u201d, but also applies to all school events held on or off campus. This means a Parent returning from a day of hunting should not have the rifle or shotgun in their vehicle if they come to school to pick up their child or attend an evening meeting.\u00a0 Beyond strict compliance with the law, there is also the concern for the potential of some unintended tragedy whenever firearms are brought in close contact many people, including children.\u00a0\u00a0 <u>Please<\/u> use particular caution in the fall when so many citizens may be involved in hunting or target shooting activities.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"SecurityInformation\"><\/a>Security Information<\/h2>\n<p>Events that may endanger the welfare of our students and staff are extraordinary and require a commitment to planning as well as coordinated action by our Building Emergency Response Team (BERT) to evaluate, lower the threat level and to work closely with local emergency providers once they enter school property. We have no control over when these events may occur. It is imperative that we implement a response system that includes the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensures the safety of students, staff and visitors<\/li>\n<li>Protects district facilities, property and interests<\/li>\n<li>Stabilizes the incident in a brief period of time<\/li>\n<li>Provides support to and works collaboratively with emergency providers<\/li>\n<li>Communicates effectively with Parents and media.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In order to ensure that our students and staff remain safe during the school day, please adhere to the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>During each visit to our school, please be sure to report to the\u00a0designated sign in desk,\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">to<\/span>present a photo ID, sign in and receive a visitor\u2019s badge.<\/li>\n<li>Report directly to the location you designated on the sign in sheet and return to the\u00a0designated sign in desk\u00a0immediately after leaving your designated location.<\/li>\n<li>If your intended destination in the building is changed, or altered, you must report this change immediately to the\u00a0sign in location.<\/li>\n<li>Report any suspicious and\/or unusual activity observed on school property to the Building Principal\u00a0or building staff.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a id=\"TransportationGuidelines\"><\/a>Transportation Guidelines<\/h2>\n<h3>Transportation Purpose and Objective<\/h3>\n<p>Pupil transportation is a necessary service and an integral part of the total educational program. The major objectives of the pupil transportation program are to provide safe transportation, operate an efficient and economical transportation system, adapt transportation to the requirements of the instructional program, and maintain conditions on the buses which are conducive to the best interests of students.<\/p>\n<h3>Philosophy<\/h3>\n<p>The school bus is considered an extension of the school; therefore, the safety and welfare of all pupils riding school buses is a major responsibility of the school district. Bus discipline, in order to be effective, must be a cooperative effort involving the transportation department, administrators, parents and pupils.<\/p>\n<h3>Roles\/Responsibilities<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Transportation personnel will receive orientation on a regularly scheduled basis regarding general discipline, pupil behavior, pupil rights, bus rules and disciplinary procedures.<\/li>\n<li>Bus drivers, teachers and administrators will be responsible for orienting pupils on a regularly scheduled basis regarding bus behavior.<\/li>\n<li>Pupils will be under the authority and supervision of the bus driver while on the bus and will be expected to adhere to directions at all times.<\/li>\n<li>Bus expectations will be published and distributed to parents\/guardians, pupils and bus drivers, and they will be posted on every bus.<\/li>\n<li>Pupils who are disorderly and insubordinate will be subject to disciplinary actions.<\/li>\n<li>Disciplinary action for misbehavior will be the responsibility of building administrators in collaboration with the Director of Transportation (or their designee).<\/li>\n<li>Disciplinary action will be reasonable and administered in a progressive manner with pupil\u2019s rights to due process guaranteed.<\/li>\n<li>The Building Principal or the Director of Transportation (or their designee) will be responsible for notifying Parent of disciplinary action resulting from bus referrals in order to obtain their support and cooperation.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Unauthorized Entry on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>For safety and security reasons, unauthorized persons are not allowed to board or ride a school bus at any time, unless prior approval has been received from the transportation department. This includes Parent daycare providers, siblings and underage children.<\/p>\n<h3>Student RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) Cards<\/h3>\n<p>Students are issued RFID Cards that are used for attendance and accountability purposes on school buses. The following pertains to the use of the RFID Cards:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Students are required to use their RFID Card when boarding and leaving the bus each day. The bus driver will remind students of this requirement if they fail to use their card.<\/li>\n<li>If a student repetitively fails to scan their card when entering\/exiting the bus, or consistently loses their card, drivers may submit written discipline referrals.<\/li>\n<li>If a student has not received an RFID Card, or their card is lost or stolen, they should let their building principal know immediately so they order one for the student. All initial cards are free of charge.\u00a0 For lost or missing RFID cards, parents and\/or students will need to order a replacement card on the districts website by going \u201cFamily Links &amp; Resources\u201d and then scrolling down to \u201cStudent ID Replacement\u201d.\u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Reporting School Bus Incidents\/Concerns<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>If the incident\/concern specifically relates to the bus driver or bus driver\u2019s assistant, please call the Transportation Department at 518-587-4545 (inform receptionist).<\/li>\n<li>If the incident\/concern is student discipline related and on the school bus:\n<ol>\n<li>The first step is to inform the driver who will take the appropriate steps to address the concern.<\/li>\n<li>If this does not resolve the problem, inform your building team.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>If the concern involves bus routing or bus stops, please email the Transportation Routing Office at <a href=\"mailto:routing@saratogaschools.org\">routing@saratogaschools.org<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Any other bus concerns may be directed to the Bus Dispatch Office at 518-693-1316<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Bus Behavior Expectations<\/h3>\n<p>Students should always conduct themselves in a manner consistent with established standards for classroom behavior in accordance with the Code of Conduct.<\/p>\n<p>Inappropriate student behavior can cause the driver to become distracted, which can increase the chances of the bus being involved in an accident.

Transportation conferences may also be utilized for students accumulating 10 bus referrals and 20 days of bus suspension during a school year.<\/p>\n<h3>Transportation Changes<\/h3>\n<p>Student transportation is scheduled to and from the student&#8217;s primary residence. If transportation is needed to a different location on a regular basis for daycare or joint custody purposes, the Parent must complete a Transportation Change Form.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Transportation Change Forms must be renewed on a yearly basis by June 1 <sup>St<\/sup> for the following school year. Forms received after August 15<em><sup>th<\/sup><\/em> will not be processed until after the first week of school. For changes during the school year, submit forms as soon as possible.<\/li>\n<li>Only students in grades K \u2013 8 are eligible for transportation changes for daycare purposes.<\/li>\n<li>Transportation is available to accredited daycare centers within the school district boundaries. If your elementary school children will be attending private or home-based daycare, that location must be within the boundaries of the elementary school in which they attend.<\/li>\n<li>Requests will be approved on an annual basis if seating is available on established bus routes. Additional buses will not be added to accommodate transportation change requests.<\/li>\n<li>Students are not allowed to ride a different bus for social functions, jobs (including babysitting), scouting, religious activities or any other non-approved activity as determined by the Building Principal.<\/li>\n<li>Students who are not eligible for transportation are not permitted to ride home with a friend for an afterschool activity.<\/li>\n<li>In the event of an emergency and your child needs to ride a different bus or get off at a different stop on the same bus, please send a note to the school with your child.\u00a0 The note must then be approved by the school office.\u00a0 If an emergency occurs during the day, please contact your child\u2019s school office as soon as possible to arrange for alternate transportation.<\/li>\n<li>Transportation Change Requests: \u00a0Parent completes and submits the electronic \u201cTransportation Change Request\u201d form on the school district website.\u00a0 Assistance with this process can also be found at the Transportation Department, the Registrar\u2019s office, or each of the district\u2019s six elementary school offices.\u00a0 Upon receiving an approval\/denial from the transportation department, the transportation department notifies the Parent of the decision.\u00a0 Elementary Schools are also notified by the transportation department and are provided updated bus schedule information.\u00a0 Requests received after August 15<sup>th<\/sup> may not be honored until after school begins.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Bus Schedule Information<\/h3>\n<p>The Traversa My Ride K-12 mobile app and website provides secure access to \u201creal time\u201d student transportation information, student ID card scans, current bus location and estimated arrival time at the bus stop.

In addition, assigned seating is required on all middle school and elementary buses. Drivers should have assigned seats in place by early October after considering grade level, compatibility, behaviors, siblings, friends etc. Assigned seats are also subject to change at any time during the school year.<\/p>\n<h3>Dangerous Substances<\/h3>\n<p>D.O.T. regulations prohibit aerosol cans, glass containers and flammable substances inside the passenger compartment of school buses. Therefore, students shall not carry these items on school buses at any time. Perfumes and colognes shall not be discharged on school buses because they can cause an adverse allergic reaction with some individuals.<\/p>\n<h3>Food and Beverages on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>New York State Education Department regulations prohibit eating or drinking on the bus. The reason for this regulation is due to the danger of a child choking when eating on a school bus and due to students, who have food allergies. So, please remember, no eating or drinking on the bus at any time.<\/p>\n<h3>Transporting Large Items on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>For the safety of all occupants being transported on district school buses, the following guidelines have been established to provide information on the size of items that students may transport on school buses.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Objects smaller than 36 inches (length) by 12 inches (width) by 8 inches (depth) can be transported on school buses. These items must be kept on the student&#8217;s lap or on the floor between their legs. They must not obstruct the center aisle of the bus or be placed in a seat alongside a student, especially if another student needs to sit there.<\/li>\n<li>Objects that can obstruct or impair the vision of the driver are prohibited.<\/li>\n<li>Hockey and lacrosse sticks are allowed to be transported on the bus but must be stored behind the driver&#8217;s seat.<\/li>\n<li>Any items that are larger than the sizes listed above must be transported by other means, or arrangements may be made to store the items in the school.\u00a0 This includes large athletic equipment bags, skis, ski poles, sleds, skateboards, bicycles and fishing poles.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This policy is designed to provide the safest environment for all occupants riding on our school buses. If you have questions regarding this policy, please contact the Transportation Department at 518-587-4545.<\/p>\n<h3>Use of Personal Electronic Devices on School Buses<\/h3>\n<p>Improper use of electronics on the school bus can cause a distraction to the driver and may be detrimental to the safety and well-being of other students and bus drivers. Therefore, the following guidelines are provided in accordance with the district&#8217;s Code of Conduct policy.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cell phones and other electronic communication devices shall not be used to bully, discriminate, threaten, harass, or denigrate other students or school personnel.<\/li>\n<li>Devices may not be used while boarding\/discharging or crossing, and during emergency situations or school bus safety drills unless authorized by the driver.<\/li>\n<li>Video\/audio recordings and pictures are not allowed to be taken by students riding District buses.<\/li>\n<li>Laser pointers and other objects that can obstruct or impair the vision of the driver are not allowed to be used on school buses at any time.<\/li>\n<li>iPods, tablets, or other similar electronic devices may be used on school buses only if equipped with headphones and the volume is maintained at a level that does not disrupt the driver or other students.<\/li>\n<li>Headphones must be used when listening to music, playing games, or viewing content on devices. For student safety reasons headphones must be removed when entering\/exiting the bus or crossing at bus stops.<\/li>\n<li>Any devices that is being used inappropriately may be confiscated by bus drivers and returned to the students when they depart the bus. If a student continues to use their device inappropriately, a discipline referral may be submitted, and the device may be confiscated and returned only to a Parent.<\/li>\n<li>The school District will not be held responsible for the loss or theft of any personal electronic device.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Failure to follow these and any bus rules may result in disciplinary action in accordance with the Code of Conduct.<\/p>\n<h3>Late Buses<\/h3>\n<p>Late buses operate from the High School and Middle School on a schedule set by each school. The following are the guidelines for the late runs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students are required to submit a late run pass to the bus driver as well as scan their school provided ID card upon boarding the bus. The pass must be signed by a teacher and approved by the school\u2019s office.<\/li>\n<li>Late run route zone maps are available on the School District\u2019s website.<\/li>\n<li>As there are only a limited number of buses for each school, ride times will vary depending on the number of students riding on a given day. The drivers adjust their routing daily in order to minimize ride times; however, ride times will be longer on days when there are many students riding. You may contact the transportation dispatch office at (518)693-1316 after the departure time of the late runs for an approximate arrival time for your student.<\/li>\n<li>Students will be dropped off as close as possible to their regularly assigned bus stops only and are not allowed to be dropped off at places of employment, social events, or other activities.<\/li>\n<li>Students will not be allowed to ride to the YMCA unless they are enrolled in a YMCA sanctioned after-school program.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a id=\"DASA\"><\/a>Dignity for All Students Act (DASA)<\/h2>\n<p>The Dignity for All Students Act (DASA) was enacted effective July 1, 2012. The purpose of DASA is to afford all public-school students an environment free of discrimination and harassment. DASA prohibits harassment of students by employees and fellow students.<\/p>\n<p>Bullying is defined as an intentional act of aggression based on an imbalance of power that is meant to harm a victim either physically or psychologically. This usually occurs repeatedly over time but could be a single serious event. DASA incidents may happen in school, at school events, or off campus if it involves cyberbullying or an event that affects the victim\u2019s ability to attend school and fully take part in our academic and extracurricular programs.<\/p>\n<p>Students are protected under DASA if the bullying involves incidents related to the following \u201cProtected Classes.\u201d<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Race (Actual or perceived)<\/li>\n<li>Color<\/li>\n<li>Weight (Size)<\/li>\n<li>National Origin<\/li>\n<li>Ethnic Group<\/li>\n<li>Religion, Religious Practice<\/li>\n<li>Disability<\/li>\n<li>Sexual Orientation, Gender (Including gender identity or expression) or Sex<\/li>\n<li>Cyber-Bullying<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Incidents of bullying or cyberbullying may be pursued through informal intervention and mediation or through the filing of a formal complaint.

FERPA is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of student records. The law gives parents and students over 18 years of age (referred to in the law as \u201celigible students\u201d) the following rights:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The right to inspect and review the student\u2019s education records within 45 days of the day the district receives a request for access. \u00a0Parents or eligible students should submit to the Building Principal a written request that identifies the records they wish to inspect. The principal will plan for access and notify the Parent or eligible student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.<\/li>\n<li>The right to request the amendment of the student\u2019s education records that the Parent or eligible student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Parents or eligible students may ask the district to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading by writing the Building Principal, clearly identifying the part of the record they want to change and specifying why it is inaccurate or misleading. Please note that the amendment procedure may not be used to challenge a grade, an opinion, or a substantive decision made by the school district about a student.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If the district decides not to amend the record as requested by the Parent or eligible student, the district will notify the Parent or eligible student of the decision and advise them of their right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the Parent or eligible student when notified of the right to a hearing.<\/p>\n<p>The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student\u2019s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. There is an exception to FERPA\u2019s prohibition against non-consensual disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, pursuant to which the district may disclose personally identifiable information from education records without consent.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to \u201cschool officials\u201d with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the district as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel); a person serving on the school board; a person or company with whom the district has contracted to perform a special task (such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist); or a \u00a0Parent or student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. With respect to what constitutes a \u2018legitimate education interest\u2019, it is generally accepted that a school official generally has a legitimate education interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill their professional responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>A student or Parent who believes there has been a violation of the provisions of FERPA may file a complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20202-5920. Complaints must contain specific allegations of fact giving reasonable cause to believe that a violation of FERPA has occurred. <a href=\"https:\/\/studentprivacy.ed.gov\/ferpa\">More information regarding the complaint process is available at the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s website.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Notification<\/h3>\n<p>The Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) generally protects \u201cstudent records\u201d from disclosure. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose, without Parent consent, certain \u201cdirectory information\u201d such as a student\u2019s name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, participation in athletics, honors, awards, and photographs, unless Parents have advised the district to the contrary. The primary purpose of the &#8220;directory information&#8221; exception to FERPA is to allow Saratoga Springs City School District (SSCSD) to include this type of information in school publications such as newsletters, calendars, the school district website, ParentSquare, and social media outlets.

This is in keeping with efforts to establish an environment in which the dignity and worth of each member of the school community is respected. The district&#8217;s goal is to provide a community where all students and staff are accepted as individuals.<\/p>\n<p>Harassment of any member of the school community by an individual is prohibited on school property or in connection with school-related activities.<\/p>\n<h3>Complaint Processing<\/h3>\n<p>The District will promptly and thoroughly investigate all complaints of discrimination and\/or harassment whether verbal or written, formal or informal.

Forming a sense of identity and belonging is a major developmental task for students. In any group activity, building a spirit of team comradery should be an important goal. The Saratoga Springs City School District enacts this policy to ensure and maintain a safe learning environment for students that is free from hazing. Hazing activities of any type are inconsistent with the educational goals of the school district and are prohibited at all times.<\/p>\n<h3>Definition of Hazing<\/h3>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\">\n<li>\u201cHazing\u201d means committing an act against a student or group of students, or coercing a student into committing an act that creates a risk of harm to a person, in order for the student to be initiated into or affiliated with a student organization, or for any other purpose. The term hazing includes, but is not limited to:\n<ol>\n<li>Any humiliating or dangerous activity expected of a student to join a group, regardless of the student\u2019s willingness to participate (conduct has the potential to endanger the mental or physical health or safety of a student).<\/li>\n<li>Any hurtful, aggressive, destructive or disruptive behavior such as but not limited to striking, stripping, sleep deprivation, confinement in a restricted area, calisthenics or other activity that subjects the student to a risk of harm or that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of the student.<\/li>\n<li>Any use or abuse of tobacco, alcohol, drugs or other substances that subjects the student to a risk of harm or that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of that student.<\/li>\n<li>Any activity that intimidates or threatens the student with ostracism; subjects a student to mental stress, embarrassment, shame or humiliation; or adversely affects the mental health or dignity of the student or group of students.<\/li>\n<li>Any activity that causes or requires the student to perform a task that involves violation of state or federal law or of school district policies and regulations.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><a id=\"Custody\"><\/a>Custody<\/h2>\n<p>If custody of a child is limited by court order, a signed copy of that order must be on file at the school. Without a signed court order, either Parent may request to see a teacher, be contacted in an emergency, view school records or sign a child out of school. If custody papers have been updated, it is imperative to provide the school with a copy of the most recent court order. \u00a0Parents should make sure the court papers on file are the most recent and that the rulings listed are current.<\/p>\n<h3><a id=\"FirstNameBirthGenderChange\"><\/a> AFFIRMED First Name\/Birth Gender Change<\/h3>\n<p>In an effort to protect privacy, maintain confidentiality and create a safe and supportive environment for Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Students, the District continues to hone its practices and protocols in order to comply with the guidance that has been provided by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), the New York State Education Department (SED) and the New York State Board of Regents.
