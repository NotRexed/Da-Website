The District has six elementary schools and there are attendance zones for each elementary school, as well as five flex attendance zones. The elementary population in each zone is ever-changing due to new construction, home sales, age progression and other factors.<\/p>\n<p>Student placement is based on available capacity within the class size target of your child\u2019s specific grade level and the attendance zone you live in. As stated above, it is sometimes necessary to transfer students into an alternate elementary school based on class size targets being at capacity.<\/p>\n<p>If you are planning on moving into our district and would like to know what elementary attendance zone your potential home is located in, please call Mrs. Valerie ElSawi, School Registrar, at 518-583-4789.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do I have to be residing in the district boundaries to register my children for school?
