Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is the approach our District uses to build a safe and effective school environment. PBIS is a systemic approach to improving the climate of a building by placing an emphasis on being proactive, preventative, and positive. Other support we have added include Mental Health Clinics, Project Lift, Social Workers, and more.<\/p>\n<p>While we have many structures and systems in place to create safe learning environments, we know that you also play a key role in maintaining safety. The District continues to embrace a \u201cSee Something, Say Something\u201d campaign to raise awareness about the importance of being vigilant in our school community. The District also now utilizes the Safe School Helpline. Safety is everyone\u2019s responsibility, and we encourage you to keep this theme in mind year-round.<\/p>\n<p>As a school community, safety is on our mind all of the time and we continue to evaluate how we can make improvements in this area.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Safe_School_Helpline\"><\/a>Safe School Helpline<\/h2>\n<p>If you see something, say something!

So, what is it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shelter-in-Place\/Shelter<\/strong>: This procedure is used to shelter staff and students inside the building. An example when this could occur would be severe weather.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hold-in-Place\/Hold<\/strong>: This procedure is used to limit movement of students and staff while dealing with short-term emergencies. An example would be a medical emergency.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Evacuate<\/strong>: This procedure is used to evacuate students and staff from the building. An example would be a gas leak or a fire alarm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Secure Lockout:<\/strong> This procedure is used to secure school buildings and grounds during incidents that pose a concern outside of the school. An example would be a wild animal near the school or police activity in the area.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lockdown: <\/strong>Used to secure school buildings and grounds during incidents that pose an immediate threat of violence in or around the school. School staff and students are trained in how to respond to a lockdown through drills and practice. These drills are conducted in an age-appropriate and trauma-informed manner. Please note: During an actual lockdown or a lockdown drill, the blue lights outside the school buildings will flash. If you see the blue lights flashing, do not approach or attempt to enter the building.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Safety is an underlying theme in everything we do, and we want to remind our school community about the importance we place on student and staff safety every day at the Saratoga Springs City School District.
