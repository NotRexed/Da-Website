Please be advised that the law does not allow and prohibits the release of any additional information about the individual teacher beyond the final rating and composite score. The purpose of this notice is to inform you of this right and the process by which you may request such information.<\/p>\n<p>Only parents and legal guardians may have access to the final quality rating and composite score of the student\u2019s teacher(s) and principal. The School District is required by the law to take reasonable steps to insure that the person requesting the information is a parent or legal guardian of the student to whom the teacher(s) or principal is assigned. Therefore, any request must be in writing on the form provided with this notice. No oral requests will be honored. The School District may request additional verification such as licenses or other photo identification to verify that the person requesting the information is the parent or legal guardian of the student. In the case of legal guardians, the School District will require proof of guardianship (e.g. court orders, etc.). The status of the requesting person will be verified against other information concerning the student in the possession of the School District (e.g. information or documents submitted at the time of registration) and the requesting person will be notified once his\/her request has been verified and approved.<\/p>\n<p>Once the request is approved, an appointment with the administrator, or designated individual authorized to release such information, will be arranged. At the meeting the rating and score will be verbally provided. At this same meeting, the parent or guardian will also receive the required explanation regarding the rating and score to best understand them in the context of teacher evaluation and student performance. In the event a parent or guardian is unable to meet in person, they may receive the information verbally by phone.<\/p>\n<p>Since all of the information needed to establish final teacher and principal ratings and composite scores is not provided until the beginning of school (i.e., final information is often provided by the State Education Department to school districts on or around September 1st), the availability to receive the final rating and composite scores for a student\u2019s teacher(s) and principal for the 2013-2014 school year shall not be accessible by parents\/legal guardians until September 16, 2013. Requests for the information may be made anytime on or after that date.<\/p>\n<p>Please be advised that a teacher or principal may appeal their final rating and composite score. This may impact the timing of when such information can be provided to a parent or guardian since, if an appeal is filed by the teacher or principal to the APPR rating, the rating and composite score will not be available until that appeal process has concluded.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions about this procedure, please contact the Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment at 518-583-4474.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to request composite scores on your child\u2019s teacher(s) and\/or principal please download the request form by clicking here.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like a more in-depth explanation of how the composite score is developed, please click here to read the explanation as outlined by the WSWHE BOCES Network Team.<\/p>\n<p>Once you complete the form please turn it in to the appropriate administrative office for processing.<br \/>\n\u2022 If you are requesting a teacher\u2019s score, return the form to the principal of your child\u2019s building.<br \/>\n\u2022 If you are requesting the score of the building principal , please send the form to the Assistant Superintendent for 21st Century Teaching and Learning:<\/p>\n<p>Lisa M.
