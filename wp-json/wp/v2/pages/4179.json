By carefully selecting elective subjects that meet your needs and satisfy your interests and abilities, you may work toward your own educational, career and technical, and personal goals.\u00a0 It is the student\u2019s responsibility to consult with his\/her parent\/guardian, teachers, and school counselor.<\/p>\n<h4>College Entrance Requirements<\/h4>\n<p>Specific subject and grade average requirements vary from one institution to another, as the institutions differ in the programs they offer and the kinds of students they seek. College\u2019s value a high school program that includes four years of English and Social Studies, four years of Math and Science, and two to five years of World Languages.\u00a0 College bound students looking to drop one of these areas before they graduate should do so only after careful consultation with teachers, counselors, and college\/universities.<\/p>\n<h4>Advancing Through Sequential Courses<\/h4>\n<p>There are specific course prerequisites for advancing through sequential courses in some departments. Please read the course descriptions thoroughly.<\/p>\n<h4>Class Placement \/ Promotion Policy<\/h4>\n<p>Class placement is based on the number of credits previously earned.\u00a0 A student must have a minimum of 5.5 credits to be part of the sophomore class.\u00a0 Students must accumulate 11 units of credit before they are promoted to be a junior, and 15.5 units are required for classification as a senior.<\/p>\n<p>Credits Required by Grade Level:<\/p>\n<p>Grade 9:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0 to &lt; 5.5 credits\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Grade 10:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5.5 to &lt; 11 credits\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Grade 11:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 11 to &lt; 15.5 credits\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Grade 12:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 15.5 + credits\u00a0<\/p>\n<h4>Early Graduation\u00a0<\/h4>\n<p>Students seeking to complete the diploma requirements in less than four years must complete the diploma requirements applicable to the student who first entered grade nine four years prior to the school year in which the diploma is to be awarded.\u00a0\u00a0The diploma will be awarded at the end of the semester in which all requirements are completed.\u00a0\u00a0Students who wish to graduate early must review and complete the\u00a0Early Graduation Application with their school counselor. The building principal will review the application to determine if the student qualifies to graduate early.\u00a0 Applications are due for approval before September in each school year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Honor Roll Criteria\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Quarterly Honor Roll and High Honor Roll will be recognized after each quarter.

Please contact your school counselor to investigate whether this is an option for your schedule.<\/p>\n<h4>Dropping a Course<\/h4>\n<p><span>Students should make every effort to maintain a rigorous academic schedule. This includes maintaining a schedule with the minimum credits required at every grade level.\u00a0 Students are expected to take the courses they requested.\u00a0 Courses required for graduation will not be permitted to be dropped.\u00a0 For a student to replace an elective course with a study hall, the required paperwork must be completed no later than the end of the second quarter for a full year course or the end of the first quarter\/third quarter for a semester course. \u00a0<\/span><span>Only in extenuating circumstances, and with administrator approval, may a student drop after the deadline and\/or drop below the number of credits required by grade level.\u00a0 If a student is permitted to drop a course after the deadline, the course grade will indicate WF \u2013 Withdrawal Failing or WP \u2013 Withdrawal Passing on the official transcripts.\u00a0 This indication will not be calculated into the student\u2019s final average. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Course Level Changes<\/h4>\n<p>In some of our academic disciplines, multiple levels of instruction have been established to meet our diverse student population&#8217;s needs.\u00a0 Early and frequent communication with the classroom teacher is essential in making educated decisions regarding level changes.\u00a0 Key factors considered are the student\u2019s previous academic achievement, along with historic and current effort levels.\u00a0 \u00a0Attending extra help regularly and completing all assignments allows students, parents, school counselors and teachers to collectively help make an informed decision.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Students, parents\/guardians should be advised that once a student has signed up for a course, there is no assurance that a request for a level change can be accommodated.\u00a0 Requesting a level change may result in an undesirable disruption to a student\u2019s original schedule, therefore it may not be possible to honor. Course requests to level up would be based on summer work completion. Level changes are approved when requested to level down. \u00a0All requests are also subject to availability.\u00a0 \u00a0A student may change course levels if seats are available, and the required paperwork is signed and approved by the parent, counselor, teacher, department head and assigned administrator (and\/or building principal) no<em> later than one week after the first quarter ends<\/em>.\u00a0 Only in extenuating circumstances approved by administration will a student be permitted to change course levels after the deadline.\u00a0 In that case, the original course will stay on the official transcript with a grade indicated by WF \u2013 Withdrawal Failing or WP \u2013 Withdrawal Passing. \u00a0This indication will not be calculated into the student\u2019s final average.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Course Load Requirements Students in grades 9-11 must carry a minimum of 6.5 courses (including Physical Education) each semester.\u00a0 Seniors must carry a minimum of 5.5 courses (including Physical Education) each semester.
