For some students with disabilities, technology provides the only effective method for access to the general education curriculum and gives them the resources to actively participate with their peers or make progress toward their educational goals. By addressing the student\u2019s unique needs, assistive technology can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce barriers to learning;<\/li>\n<li>Assist students in progressing in their educational program;<\/li>\n<li>Provide equitable access to the State\u2019s learning standards;<\/li>\n<li>Provide students with independence as they participate and progress along with their peers in school and in post-school living, learning and working; and<\/li>\n<li>Support increased social and environmental access and completion of everyday tasks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Definition of Assistive Technology<\/h3>\n<p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA) mandates that school systems address assistive technology when it is required as part of a student\u2019s special education services, related services, or supplementary aids and services. IDEA defines assistive technology as both a device and service.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;The term assistive technology device means any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability&#8221; (P.L. 108-446, Part A, Section 602 (1)(A)).<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The term does not include a medical device that is surgically implanted, or the replacement of such device (P.L. 108-446, Part A, Section 602 (1)(B)).<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This broad definition includes a wide variety of items that might be considered as assistive technology devices. To make it easier for educators to identify tools and resources that a student may need, assistive technology is typically categorized into the following areas of need: physical, fine\/gross motor, communication, sensory, academic, recreation\/leisure, vocational, and self-help.<\/p>\n<h3>Links and Resources<\/h3>\n<p>The following frameworks have provided a clear focus for the use of AT with students with disabilities:<\/p>\n<p>Resources from New York State Education Department:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nysed.gov\/edtech\/assistive-technology\">Assistive Technology | New York State Education Department (nysed.gov)<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Assistive Technology for Students with Disabilities &#8211; NYSED<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.qiat.org\/\">QIAT Matrix<\/a>: A set of widely-applicable Quality Indicators for Assistive Technology Services in school settings helps to guide us towards improved AT practices district-wide.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.qiat.org\/\">www.qiat.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wati.org\/\">Wisconsin Assistive Technology Initiative<\/a> (WATI): is a statewide project funded by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction to help all school districts develop or improve their assistive technology services.
