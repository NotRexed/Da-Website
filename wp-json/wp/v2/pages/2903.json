The program is intended for extremely talented and gifted athletes. The selection of such athletes affects not only the individual athlete but also other athletes. High School athletes may be cut from a team or have their playing time reduced to make room for Middle School athletes. Therefore, the impact of the Athletic Placement Process each year has long-term consequences. It is important that Athletic Placement Process candidates and their parents understand their responsibility and commitment when considering this privilege. We will only keep a student on a Freshman, JV or Varsity team if it appears that the athlete will get a substantial amount of playing time. If this athlete is displacing one or more high school students who are being cut, this athlete must be clearly have superior potential to any athlete they are displacing.<br aria-hidden=\"true\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>APP Process Steps<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span>Students must pass each stage of the APP before proceeding to the next stage, and pass all stages in order to meet the requirements of the APP. If at any stage in the process it is determined not appropriate a notification letter will be emailed home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>All students must be recommended by a Saratoga Springs Coaching Staff Member to start this process.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span><b>STEP 1 Parent Permission<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>I<span>n order for your child to be eligible to participate in the sport selected outside of his or her normal grade level, we must have your permission to begin the APP.\u00a0 Parent\/Guardian permission is granted by acknowledging the agreements set forward in ArbiterSports.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>STEP 2 Administrative Approval<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span>The athletic office will confirm with the middle school administration that the student is suitable for consideration.\u00a0 Because of the increased time demands of participation at the high school level, the student&#8217;s academic performance will be reviewed to determine the students social and emotional readiness.\u00a0 This will include a grade report, attendance report, discipline report and\/or any recommendation or feedback from middle school administration and counselors.<b>\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span><b>STEP 3 Medical Approval<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The Physical Maturity and Health Form must be completed by your private physician and uploaded into ArbiterSports with your up-to-date physical.

If this is the case for your son or daughter, you will be emailed a form letter stating this notification.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span><b>STEP 4 Physical Fitness Testing\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Completion of a physical fitness test.
