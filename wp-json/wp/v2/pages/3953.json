They communicate with parents\/guardians, teachers, and other school staff to better assist in this process.\u00a0 Parents\/guardians are encouraged to consult with their child\u2019s counselor for help with a student\u2019s adjustment to school, personal growth and development, program selection, career planning, and information about colleges and scholarships.\u00a0 Counselors meet with each student at least once a year to review progress and plan courses for the following year.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Though comprehensive in nature, this course description guide is not intended to answer all the questions or concerns you may have relative to the broad educational opportunities your child will enjoy here.\u00a0 Only direct communication between home and school will accomplish that goal.\u00a0 We encourage this ongoing communication, because it is vitally important that your child not only attends school but also experiences success.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"x_elementToProof\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<div class=\"x_elementToProof\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/graduation-requirements\/\">Graduation Requirements<\/a><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/important-considerations-and-school-policies\/\">Important Considerations and School Policies<\/a><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/honors-and-advanced-placement-courses\/\">Honors and Advanced Placement Courses<\/a><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/ncaa-eligibility-information\/\">NCAA Eligibility Information<\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"x_elementToProof\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/art-department-courses\/\">Art<\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"x_elementToProof\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/business-department-courses\/\">Business Education<\/a><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/computer-science-and-applications\/\">Computer Science and Applications<\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"x_elementToProof\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/english-department-courses\/\">English<\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"x_elementToProof\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/family-and-consumer-sciences-department\/\">Family and Consumer Sciences<\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"x_elementToProof\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/mathematics-department-courses\/\">Mathematics<\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"x_elementToProof\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/music-department-courses\/\">Music<\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"x_elementToProof\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/saratoga-springs-high-school\/counseling\/academic-program-guide\/physical-education-and-health-department-courses\/\">Health &amp;
