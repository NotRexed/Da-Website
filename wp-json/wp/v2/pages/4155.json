Through real-world cases, students will learn various biomedical lab skills and explore a range of biomedical interventions related to immunology, surgery, genetics, audiology, pharmacology, medical devices, and diagnostics.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: <\/em><em>Completion of, or Co-enrollment in Biology.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>SCIENCE ELECTIVES<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h4>NATURAL DISASTERS I: METEOROLOGY<\/h4>\n<p>0339\u00a0\u00a0 1 Semester \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.5 Credit \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grades 10 -12<\/p>\n<p>This course will investigate atmospheric related natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and other severe phenomenon.
