Handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is the best practice. However, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol should be substituted when handwashing is not available.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respiratory etiquette:<\/strong> Viruses can spread from person to person in droplets produced by coughs and sneezes. Therefore, it is important that students and staff cover their mouths or noses with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue appropriately. If no tissue is available, using the inside of the elbow (or shirtsleeve) to cover the mouth or nose is preferable to using the hands. Always perform hand hygiene after sneezing, coughing, and handling dirty tissues or other soiled material.<\/p>\n<h4>Ventilation<\/h4>\n<p>The SSCSD Facilities department will ensure that all HVAC systems are set to maximize ventilation and bring in as much outdoor air as a system will safely allow. If safe to do so, open windows and doors. Even just cracking open a window or door helps increase outdoor airflow, which helps reduce the potential concentration of virus particles in the air.<\/p>\n<p>During transportation, open or crack windows in buses and other forms of transportation, if doing so does not pose a safety risk. Keeping windows open a few inches will improve air circulation.<\/p>\n<h4>Vaccinations<\/h4>\n<p>The CDC recommends that all teachers, staff, and eligible students be vaccinated.<\/p>\n<h4>Transportation<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular bus cleaning and disinfection measures will take place.<\/li>\n<li>Windows open for improved ventilation (above 45\u00b0F).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Resources<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>CDC K-12 School Guidance to Support Safe In-Person Learning<\/li>\n<li>Centers for Disease Control Stay Up to Date With Your Vaccines<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>School Reopening Plans<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/8-23updatedseccondversionOutline-Reopening-Schools.pdf\">2020-2021 Reopening Plan<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Stay-Open-Plan-for-the-21-22-School-Year-9-1-2021.pdf\">2021-2022 Stay Open Plan<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The health and safety of our school community is our highest priority, and we are committed to maintaining a healthy and safe learning environment for our students and staff.
