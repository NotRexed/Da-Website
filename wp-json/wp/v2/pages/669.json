Philosophically, the ASCA National Model provides a framework to develop a comprehensive school counseling program. The model accounts for planning, mission, objectives, accountability, professional development, and evaluation. This model emphasizes four main components:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Foundation: School counselors create comprehensive school counseling programs that focus on student outcomes, teach student competencies, and are delivered with identified professional competencies. This is the basis for the program. It is the declaration of the beliefs, mission, and vision for the Saratoga Springs Comprehensive School Counseling Program. The foundation for this at SSCSD was the district goal as established in the Pathways Vision.<\/li>\n<li>The Management Structure: School counselors incorporate organizational assessments and tools that are concrete, clearly delineated and reflective of the school\u2019s needs. It describes the process for planning, and the process and tools necessary to deliver the program. It focuses on program assessment, use\u2010of\u2010time assessment, and the use of data. Additional assessments and tools include annual and weekly calendars, annual agreements, and an advisory council.<\/li>\n<li>The Delivery System: School counselors provide services to students, parents, school staff and the community in the following areas: direct and indirect student services, school counseling curriculum, individual student planning and responsive services. This portion of the framework concentrates on the variety of delivery modalities used to implement the comprehensive school counseling program. These structures, including both direct and indirect services, range from the codified, or mapped curriculum to the instructional delivery methodologies (i.e. classroom instruction, group counseling, individual student planning, and responsive services)<\/li>\n<li>The Accountability System: To demonstrate the effectiveness of the school counseling program in measurable terms, school counselors analyze school and school counseling program data to determine how students are different because of the school counseling program. School counselors use data to show the impact of the school counseling program on student achievement, attendance and behavior and analyze school counseling program assessments to guide future action and improve future results for all students. This section helps to coordinate the ways in which the school counselors quantify the added value they provide to the entire system and individual students. This is to be done using data and the evaluation of programs as they provide the personal social supports students need to be academically successful, and to be college and career ready by the time they graduate from the Saratoga Springs City School District.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>The Saratoga Springs CSD Foundation for School Counseling<\/h2>\n<h3>We Believe:<\/h3>\n<h4>Everyone has a role<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All members of the school community play a vital role in guiding the development of our children.
