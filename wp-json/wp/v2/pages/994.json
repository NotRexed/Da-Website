To this end, the district will make every effort to place each student in the most appropriate learning level for a successful educational experience.<\/p>\n<p>District curriculum guides indicate goals for achievement by the &#8220;average&#8221; student at each grade level. However, academic growth, like physical growth, does not take place at the same pace or time for all individuals. Certain students may achieve mastery in a shorter period, while others need additional time. Early identification and intervention, promotion and retention are methods of meeting the needs of such children.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The following guidelines shall govern student progression:<\/p>\n<h2>Early Identification\/Intervention<\/h2>\n<p>Classroom teachers are expected to make every effort, consistent with the district&#8217;s implementation of response to intervention (RTI), to identify early those students at risk of failing. The Building Principal and the parents\/guardians must be notified promptly if retention is anticipated, and a special support program shall be designed for each child identified as in danger of failing. Such support services may include, but are not limited to, individualized assistance before, during or after the school day; a change in instructional approach, remedial classes; and, where appropriate, referral to the RTI Team or ultimately the Committee on Special Education for evaluation.<\/p>\n<h2>Promotion\/Retention<\/h2>\n<h3>Elementary Schools<\/h3>\n<p>At the elementary level, students who pass all subjects will be promoted. Students who do not make satisfactory progress in one or more basic subjects \u2014 Reading, English, Mathematics, Spelling, Social Studies and Science \u2014 shall have their cases considered on an individual basis and may be retained. Retention shall be limited to those situations where the best interest of the child is reasonably assured. Diligent effort shall be made to use all available resources to determine the child&#8217;s appropriate placement.<\/p>\n<h3>Middle Schools<\/h3>\n<p>Students who pass all subjects but one shall have the failure evaluated and a determination made as to the reason for the failure. The student may be required to repeat the subject, but in typical cases shall be promoted with recommendation for either summer school or assignment to a lower academic ability group. The decision shall be arrived at by consensus from a base conference approach involving teacher, Principal and guidance counselor.<\/p>\n<p>Students who fail two subjects shall have their cases considered on an individual basis through a case conference approach described above.<\/p>\n<p>Students who fail more than two subjects shall fail for the year.<\/p>\n<h3>Senior High School<\/h3>\n<p>In general, promotion from one class to the next shall be contingent upon the passing of all required subjects and the accumulation of 4 or 5 units of credit at each level.<\/p>\n<h3>Academic Standards<\/h3>\n<p>Building Principals shall be responsible for ensuring that written standards for student progress at each grade level are available to parents and others upon request. Such academic standards are to be forwarded to the Superintendent of Schools each year.<\/p>\n<h3>Retention<\/h3>\n<p>A decision to retain shall be arrived at by consensus from a case conference approach involving the teacher, Building Principal, school psychologist, and parent\/guardian. Factors to be considered include teacher recommendation; classroom achievement and attitude; standardized test scores; social and emotional development; results of the family conference; and, for identified students, recommendations by the Committee on Special Education. Standardized test scores will not be the sole or primary factor in the decision. If a consensus cannot be reached, the decision of the Building Principal shall be final.<\/p>\n<p>No student will be retained without an appropriate educational plan defining what will occur that is instructionally different for the student. Once the educational plan has been implemented, the student will be monitored regularly. The educational plan will be revised until the student demonstrates acceptable performance.<\/p>\n<p>In order to inform parents\/guardians about the district&#8217;s approach to promotion and retention, this policy will be posted on the district website and included in student and\/or parent handbooks.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Cross-ref: 4321.2, School-wide Pre-referral and Intervention<\/p>\n<p>Ref: Education Law \u00a7\u00a7 305(47); 1709; 2503(4); 3202<\/p>\n<p>8 NYCRR <span>\u00a7<\/span><span>\u00a7 100.2(II); 100.3(b)(2); 100.4(b)(2),(e)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Isqwith v.
