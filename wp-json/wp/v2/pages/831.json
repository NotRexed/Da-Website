New York State School Districts are required to develop a district-wide safety plan designed to prevent or minimize the effects of serious violent incidents, declared state disaster emergencies involving a communicable disease or local public health emergencies and other emergencies. This plan will be used to facilitate the coordination of the district with local, county and state resources in the event of such incidents or emergencies. The district-wide plan is responsive to the needs of all schools within the district and is consistent with the more detailed emergency response plans required at the school building level. Districts stand at risk from a wide variety of acts of violence, natural, and manmade disasters. To address these threats, the State of New York has enacted the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education (SAVE) law. Project SAVE is a comprehensive planning effort that addresses prevention, response, and recovery with respect to a variety of emergencies in each school district and its schools.<\/p>\n<p>The Warren-Washington-Saratoga-Hamilton-Essex BOCES, in coordination with the Saratoga Springs City School District, supports the SAVE Legislation, and intends to facilitate the planning process. The Superintendent of Saratoga Springs City School District encourages and advocates on-going district-wide cooperation and support of Project SAVE.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Section-l\"><\/a>Section l: General Considerations and Planning Guidelines<\/h2>\n<h3>A. Purpose<\/h3>\n<p>The Saratoga Springs District-Wide Safety Plan was developed pursuant to Commissioner&#8217;s Regulation 155.17. At the direction of the Saratoga Springs City School District Board of Education, the Superintendent of the Saratoga Springs City School District appointed a District-Wide Safety Team and charged it with the development and maintenance of the District-Wide Safety Plan.<\/p>\n<h3>B. Identification of School Teams<\/h3>\n<p>The Saratoga Springs City School District has a District Emergency Response Team and Building Emergency Response Teams for each building. The initial response to all emergencies at an individual school will be by the Building Emergency Response Team. The District team is responsible for emergencies at the MacFadden Building, Duplainville Road Facilities, and supports all building teams in the event of an actual emergency.<\/p>\n<p>The District-Wide Emergency Response team was appointed by the BOE on June 20, 2024. The members of the team are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glenn Barrett<\/li>\n<li>Hillary Brewer<\/li>\n<li>Eric Bush<\/li>\n<li>Lisa Cutting<\/li>\n<li>John Dupras<\/li>\n<li>Andrea Dycha<\/li>\n<li>John Goodson<\/li>\n<li>Mike Goodwin<\/li>\n<li>Joe Greco<\/li>\n<li>Betsy Iaquinta<\/li>\n<li>Micki Jones<\/li>\n<li>John Joyce<\/li>\n<li>Jerome Keenan<\/li>\n<li>Mark Leffler<\/li>\n<li>David L\u2019Hommedieu<\/li>\n<li>Lucas Manny<\/li>\n<li>Maura Manny<\/li>\n<li>Debra Meerdink<\/li>\n<li>Aaron Moore<\/li>\n<li>Stacey Moulton<\/li>\n<li>Lucille Murphy<\/li>\n<li>Laurie Newcomer<\/li>\n<li>Bethany Nightingale<\/li>\n<li>Michael Patton<\/li>\n<li>Darrell Payton<\/li>\n<li>Kim Ross<\/li>\n<li>John Thuener<\/li>\n<li>Jon Van Alstyne<\/li>\n<li>Ryan Warner<\/li>\n<li>Diane Woodard<\/li>\n<li>Robert Yusko<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Members of the Building-Level Response Team, a representative of the BOE and high school students are included in the monthly DERT Training. Those individuals act as a conduit for all stakeholders in the District.<\/p>\n<h3>C. Concept of Operations<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The District-Wide Safety Plan shall be directly linked to the individual Building-Level Emergency Response Plans for Saratoga Springs City School District. The protocols reflected in the District-Wide Safety Plan will be used to guide the development and implementation of the individual Building-Level Emergency Response Plans.<\/li>\n<li>The development of the District-Wide Safety Plan was a collaborative effort involving members of the District Emergency Response Team, Building Emergency Response Teams, law enforcement officials, county emergency service coordinators, and the Capital Region BOCES Health Safety Risk Management Services. The plan was further developed utilizing the guidelines provided by the New York State Education Department.<\/li>\n<li>The Superintendent has appointed the Assistant Superintendent for Information Technology and Operational Innovation as the Chief Emergency Officer. The Chief Emergency Officer, or designee, is responsible for:\n<ul>\n<li>coordinating the communication between school staff, law enforcement, and other first responders;<\/li>\n<li>leading the efforts of the district-wide school safety team in the yearly update of the district-wide school safety plan;<\/li>\n<li>coordinating the district-wide plan with the building-level emergency response plans;<\/li>\n<li>ensuring staff understands the district\u2013wide school safety plan;<\/li>\n<li>ensuring the completion and yearly update of building-level emergency response plans for each school building;<\/li>\n<li>assisting in the selection of security related technology and development of procedures for the use of such technology;<\/li>\n<li>coordinating appropriate safety, security, and emergency training for district and school staff, including required training in the emergency response plan;<\/li>\n<li>ensuring that all evacuation and lockdown drills required by Education Law section 807 are completed in all District buildings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>In the event of an emergency or violent incident, the initial response to all emergencies at an individual school will be by the Building Emergency Response Team. The Saratoga Springs City School District consists of the following facilities:\n<ul>\n<li>MacFadden Administration Building<\/li>\n<li>High School<\/li>\n<li>Maple Avenue Middle School<\/li>\n<li>Caroline Street Elementary School<\/li>\n<li>Division Street Elementary School<\/li>\n<li>Dorothy Nolan Elementary School<\/li>\n<li>Geyser Road Elementary School<\/li>\n<li>Greenfield Elementary School<\/li>\n<li>Lake Avenue Elementary School<\/li>\n<li>Transportation\/Bus Garage<\/li>\n<li>Operations and Facilities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All information pertaining to an emergency or violent incident will be directed to either the Building Principal\/Designee or the District Emergency Response Team.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upon the activation of the Building Emergency Response Team, the Superintendent of Schools or their designee and District Emergency Response Team will be notified. When appropriate, local emergency officials will also be notified by calling 911.<\/li>\n<li>County and State resources through existing established protocols may supplement emergency response efforts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>D. Plan Review and Public Comment<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This plan shall be reviewed and maintained by the District and Building Emergency Response Teams on an annual basis.<\/li>\n<li>When significant changes are made, pursuant to Commissioner&#8217;s Regulation 155.17(e) (3), this plan will be made available for public comment 30 days prior to adoption. The district-wide and building-level plans may be adopted by the School Board only after at least one public hearing that provides for the participation of school personnel, parents, students and any other interested parties. The plan must be formally adopted by the Board of Education.<\/li>\n<li>While linked to the District-Wide Safety Plan, the Building-Level Emergency Response Plans shall be confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under Article 6 of the Public Officers Law or any other provision of law, in accordance with Education Law Section 2801-a.<\/li>\n<li>Full copies of the District-Wide Safety Plan and Amendments must be submitted to the New York State Education Department upon adoption by the Board of Education.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a id=\"Section-II\"><\/a>Section II: Risk Reduction\/Prevention and Intervention<\/h2>\n<h3>Prevention\/Intervention Strategies<\/h3>\n<h4>Program Initiatives<\/h4>\n<p>The Saratoga Springs City School District has offered programs and activities for improving communications among students, parents or persons in parental relation and staff in order to prevent potentially violent incidents.

Threats should be reviewed by the administrator, school resource officer, school social worker, psychologist and if necessary, the threat should be triaged by the appropriate Behavioral Threat Assessment Team. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Staff will receive training by September 15<sup>th<\/sup> of each school year to identify the early warning signs of potential violent behaviors. This training will occur using the Vector Solutions\u00a0Training Portal.<\/p>\n<p>Training on the purposes and procedures of the Behavioral Threat Assessment Team shall be conducted annually. \u00a0<\/p>\n<h4>Training, Drills, and Exercises<\/h4>\n<p>The Saratoga Springs City School District has developed policies and procedures for annual multi-hazard school safety training for staff and students, including the strategies for implementing training related to multi-hazards. \u00a0All drills required by the NYS Department of Education are satisfied annually and must follow a trauma informed approach. Drills and training must not include props, actors, simulations, or other tactics intended to mimic a school shooting, incident of violence or other emergency. School District building administrators will be required to notify parents\/guardians of upcoming drills. When a drill occurs, staff and students must be informed that the event is a drill and not an actual emergency.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The District will submit certification to NYSED that all district and school staff have undergone annual training on the emergency response plan, and that the school safety training includes components on violence prevention and mental health. New employees hired after the start of the school year will receive training within 30 days of hire. The District will certify that all school staff receives this training by September 15th of each school year, or within 30 days of hire, whichever is sooner.<\/li>\n<li>Full participation in the Annual Early Dismissal -Go Home Evacuation Drill.<\/li>\n<li>Full participation in an On-Site Sheltering and Accountability Drill.<\/li>\n<li>Full participation with an Annual Evacuation and Relocation Drill.<\/li>\n<li>Full participation with 4 Building Lockdown\/Security Drills annually.<\/li>\n<li>The District conducts 8 Fire Alarm Activation and Evacuation Drills annually.<\/li>\n<li>The District conducts 4 School Bus Safety and Evacuation Drills annually.<\/li>\n<li>Emergency Response Team members participate in simulated tabletop exercises multiple times annually to test the building-level safety plan components.<\/li>\n<li>The District conducts drills and other training exercises to test components of the emergency response in coordination with the following agencies:\n<ul>\n<li>Saratoga County Office of Emergency Services<\/li>\n<li>Saratoga County Sheriff&#8217;s Department<\/li>\n<li>Saratoga Springs City Police Department<\/li>\n<li>Saratoga Springs Fire Department<\/li>\n<li>Town of Greenfield Fire Department<\/li>\n<li>New York State Police Troop G<\/li>\n<li>Department of Homeland Security<\/li>\n<li>Capital Region BOCES Health Safety Risk Management Service<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the District chooses to participate in a full-scale exercise in conjunction with local and county emergency responders and preparedness officials utilizing props, actors, simulations or other tactics intended to mimic a school shooting or other act of violence, such exercise must not be conducted on a regular school day or when other activities including athletics are occurring on school grounds. In addition, such exercises cannot include students without written consent from parents or persons in parental relation.<\/p>\n<p>Note: Directly following tests or drills, a debriefing will be conducted to evaluate the exercises and determine if changes to the emergency response plan are necessary. Notes are taken during exercises and the debriefing, which are used during the evaluation process.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Trauma Informed Approach<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A trauma-informed approach is a way of understanding and responding to people who have experienced trauma, which can affect their sense of self, others, and the world. It involves realizing the widespread impact of trauma, recognizing the signs and symptoms of trauma, and integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices. It also seeks to promote empowerment and recovery and minimize re- traumatization. A trauma-informed approach is a culture shift that requires collaboration among different sectors of public service, such as education, health, law, and social work. (NYS DOH)<\/p>\n<h4>Training of Students<\/h4>\n<p>The District has created age-appropriate handouts that will be given to all school-aged children during the first full week of school.

District Support for Buildings<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Each Building-Level Emergency Response Plan provides resources for supporting the Emergency Response Team and Post-Incident Response Team at Saratoga Springs City School District. The District&#8217;s Incident Command System Plan identifies alternates to relieve team members, and interfaces with the Post-Incident Response Plan to provide team members the opportunity to debrief and rehab in a controlled environment. Additionally, members of the Post-Incident Response Team will be provided with sufficient manpower to allow the rotation of personnel, and the opportunity to debrief and rehab in a controlled environment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>B. Disaster Mental Health Services<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Administrative branch of the Post-Incident Response Team will work through the School Psychologist, School Counseling Leader, and School Nurse to coordinate disaster mental health resources through the County Mental Health Department, community resources, neighboring school districts, and other disaster mental health resources to fully support members of the crisis response team.<\/li>\n<li>A debriefing of the Post-Incident Response Team is an essential part of the recovery phase following an emergency incident. The debriefing will be used in part to evaluate the district&#8217;s plan for possible revisions. The Post-Incident Response Plan was implemented March 1, 2017.

This plan is built upon the components of the District-Wide School Safety and the Building-Level Emergency Response Plan(s). The Plan includes elements of COVID-19 Reopening Plan and will be updated regularly to reflect current guidance and best practices. The District Leadership Team assumes responsibility for development and compliance with all provisions of this plan and its implementation.<\/p>\n<p>The district will work closely with the Saratoga County Department of Health (local health department) to determine the need for activation of this plan. The district will report suspected and confirmed cases of communicable diseases (e.g., influenza, coronavirus, etc.) on the monthly Communicable Disease Report, (DMS-485.7\/93; HE-112.4\/81) and submit it to the local health department. Depending on the severity of the disease, the district may be required to report information more frequently and, in another format, (i.e., daily for COVID-19).The local health department will monitor county-wide communicable disease cases and inform school districts as to appropriate actions.<\/p>\n<p>When this plan is activated, the District Leadership Team may invite additional people to the meetings to aid in the planning efforts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Superintendent<\/li>\n<li>Nursing Supervisor<\/li>\n<li>School nurse(s)<\/li>\n<li>District Doctor and Saratoga County Department of Health<\/li>\n<li>Assistant Superintendent of Information Technology, Operational Innovation and supporting staff<\/li>\n<li>Personnel Development Director<\/li>\n<li>Pupil Services Director<\/li>\n<li>Assistant Superintendent of Business and supporting staff<\/li>\n<li>Facility Director and supporting staff<\/li>\n<li>Food Service Director and supporting staff<\/li>\n<li>Transportation Director and supporting staff (e.g. bus drivers and assistants\/aides)<\/li>\n<li>Director of Community Outreach and Communications<\/li>\n<li>Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum, Instruction, Assessment and Curriculum Directors<\/li>\n<li>Emergency Responders<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Communication with parents, students, staff, and the school community is important throughout a pandemic outbreak.

However, cloth face coverings are important as a source control for Pandemics and provides some protection to the wearer. As such, OSHA strongly encourages workers to wear face coverings.<\/p>\n<p>Those individuals that are required to wear N-95 respirators will be fit-tested and medically screened prior to use to ensure they are physically able to do so. The use of cloth face coverings to reduce the spread of communicable diseases is important to the health and safety of faculty, staff, and students. Cloth face coverings are meant to protect other people incase the wearer is unknowingly infected (asymptomatic) and are essential when physical distancing is difficult. Information will be provided to faculty, staff and students on proper use, removal, and cleaning of cloth face coverings. All faculty, staff and students will be encouraged to utilize their own personal face coverings, but the district will secure and provide face coverings as needed.<\/p>\n<p>PPE and face coverings will be stored in a manner which will prevent degradation. These supplies will be monitored to ensure integrity and track usage rates. District communication on how to access PPE will be provided.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>E. Response Protocols for Preventing Spread<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The District-Wide School Safety Team will meet to determine the need for the activation of a pandemic response based on internal monitoring and correspondence with the local health department and other experts.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Incident Command Structure at both the District and Building level will be informed that the response effort has been enacted. These individuals will meet to discuss the plan\u2019s activation and review responsibilities and communication procedures.<\/li>\n<li>Communications will work closely with the IT department to re-test all communication systems to ensure proper function. The District-wide School Safety Team and Building-Level Emergency Response Teams will assist in this effort.<\/li>\n<li>An alert will be sent to the school community upon the activation of this plan. The communication will be based on the latest information from the federal, state, and local health authorities.<\/li>\n<li>If the decision is made to close a school building, the district will notify the NYS Education Department and District Superintendent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The district leadership team will oversee and implement all aspects of the district\u2019s reopening plan and any phased-in reopening activities. The district will assign a communicable disease safety coordinator. The coordinator shall be the main contact upon the identification of positive communicable disease cases and are responsible for subsequent communication. The coordinator shall be responsible for answering questions from students, faculty, staff, and parents or legal guardians of students regarding the public health emergency and plans implemented by the school.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hand Hygiene<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Faculty, staff, and students will be trained on proper hand hygiene. Information will be provided to parents and\/or legal guardians on ways to reinforce hand hygiene at home. The district will provide stations around the school buildings:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For hand washing: soap, running water, and disposable paper towels.<\/li>\n<li>For hand sanitizing: an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol for areas where hand washing facilities may not be available or practical.<\/li>\n<li>Accommodations for students who cannot use hand sanitizer will be made.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Communicable Disease Exposures<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The district must be prepared for communicable disease outbreaks in their local communities and for individual exposure events to occur in their facilities, regardless of the level of community transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) have provided recommendations for strategies to follow after an exposure:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Close off areas used by a sick person and not using these areas until after cleaning and disinfection has occurred;<\/li>\n<li>Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the area.<\/li>\n<li>Wait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfection. If waiting 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible;<\/li>\n<li>Clean and disinfect all areas used by the person suspected or confirmed to have a communicable disease, such as offices, classrooms, bathrooms, lockers, and common areas.<\/li>\n<li>Once the area has been appropriately cleaned and disinfected it can be reopened for use.<\/li>\n<li>Individuals without close or proximate contact with the person suspected or confirmed to have a communicable disease can return to the area and resume school activities immediately after cleaning and disinfection.<\/li>\n<li>If more than seven days have passed since the person who is suspected or confirmed to have a communicable disease visited or used the facility, additional cleaning or disinfection is not necessary, but routine cleaning and disinfection should continue.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Returning after Illness<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The district has established protocols and procedures, in consultation with the local health department(s), about the requirements for determining when individuals, particularly students, who screened positive for communicable disease symptoms can return to the in-person learning environment at school. This protocol includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Documentation from a health care provider following evaluation<\/li>\n<li>Negative COVID-19 diagnostic test result<\/li>\n<li>Symptom resolution, or if positive for a communicable disease, release from isolation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The district will refer to the NYSDOH\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nysed.gov\/coronavirus\/guidance-p-12-schools\">Pre-K to Gr 12 COVID-19 Toolkit<\/a>\u201d and other applicable guidance regarding protocols and policies for faculty, staff, and students seeking to return to work after a suspected or confirmed communicable disease case or after the faculty or staff member had close or proximate contact with a person with a communicable disease. The district requires that individuals who were exposed to a communicable disease complete quarantine and have no symptoms before returning to in-person learning. The discharge of an individual from quarantine and return to school will be conducted in coordination with the local health department.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cleaning\/Disinfecting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The district will ensure adherence to hygiene and cleaning and disinfection requirements as advised by the CDC and NYSDOHAttachment 2 describes cleaning and disinfection protocols and procedures for the district. Regular cleaning and disinfection of the facilities will occur, including more frequent cleaning and disinfection for high-risk and frequently touched surfaces. This will include desks and cafeteria tables, which will be cleaned and disinfected between each individual\u2019s use. Cleaning and disinfection will be rigorous and ongoing and will occur at least daily, or more frequently as needed.<\/p>\n<p>The district will ensure regular cleaning and disinfection of restrooms. Restrooms will be cleaned and disinfected more often depending on frequency of use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>F. Contact Tracing Supports<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The district will notify the state and local health department immediately upon being informed of any positive communicable disease diagnostic test result by an individual within school facilities or on school grounds, including students, faculty, staff, and visitors of the district. Districts may assist with contact tracing by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping accurate attendance records of students and staff members<\/li>\n<li>Ensuring student schedules are up to date<\/li>\n<li>Keeping a log of any visitor which includes date and time, and where in the school they visited<\/li>\n<li>Assisting the local health departments in tracing all contacts of the individual in accordance with the protocol, training, and tools provided through the NYS Contact Tracing Program<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The district, in consultation with the local health department, will determine what process will be followed when communicable disease cases are discovered in the school (e.g., how many individuals will be quarantined, closing of areas or classrooms, etc.). Confidentiality must be maintained as required by federal and state laws and regulations. School staff should not try to determine who is to be excluded from school based on contact without guidance and direction from the local health department.<\/p>\n<p><strong>G. Housing for Essential Employees<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Emergency housing for essential workers is not considered to be required for school faculty and staff. The need for emergency housing will be determined with direction from the local department of health.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recovery<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Re-establishing the normal school curriculum is essential to the recovery process and should occur as soon as possible. The district will:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work toward a smooth transition from the existing learning methods to the normal process.<\/li>\n<li>Use the described communication methods to keep the school community aware of the transition process.<\/li>\n<li>Work closely with the New York State Education Department to revise or amend the school calendar as deemed appropriate.<\/li>\n<li>Evaluate all building operations for normal function and re-implement appropriate maintenance and cleaning procedures.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Each Building-Level Post-incident Response Team will assess the emotional impact of the crisis on students and staff and make recommendations for appropriate intervention. The District-Wide School Safety Team and Building-Level Emergency Response Teams will meet to de-brief and determine lessons learned with input from all essential functions. The District-Wide School Safety Plan and Building-Level Emergency Response Plans will be updated accordingly.

The Emergency Remote Instruction Plan meets the requirements of New York State Education Commissioner\u2019s Regulations for inclusion in the 2023-2024 District-Wide School Safety Plan. Additionally, the plan adheres to guidance set forth in the following Board of Education policies: 5100 Student Attendance, 5300 District Code of Conduct, 8630 Computer Resources and Data Management, 8635 Information and Data Privacy Security, Breach and Notification Staff Use of District Technology and Student Use of District Technology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<u>BACKGROUND INFORMATION<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The NYS Education Department (NYSED) authorized a \u201csnow day pilot\u201d program during the Covid-19 pandemic 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years. This program allowed school districts to deliver instruction remotely on days in which they would otherwise have closed due to an emergency.<\/p>\n<p>To give districts greater predictability, in September 2022, the NYSED Board of Regents amended section 175.5(e) of the Commissioner\u2019s regulations to codify this flexibility. Districts that would otherwise close due to an emergency may, <strong>but are not required to<\/strong>, remain in session and provide instruction through remote learning and count these instructional days towards the annual hours requirement for State Aid purposes. Instruction must be provided to all students and be consistent with the definition of remote instruction, as explained below. In addition, beginning with the 2023-2024 school year, such instruction must be consistent with the school district\u2019s Emergency Remote Instruction Plan.<\/p>\n<p>NYSED also amended section 155.17 of the Commissioner\u2019s regulations to require public schools, BOCES, and county vocational education and extension boards amend their District-wide School Safety Plans to include plans for remote instruction beginning with the 2023-2024 school year. This gives the public an opportunity to provide feedback on such plans for remote instruction prior to their adoption. The Emergency Remote Instruction Plan must include the methods that the school district will ensure the availability of: devices; internet access; provision of special education and related services for students with disabilities; the expectations for time spent in different remote modalities.<\/p>\n<p>Such plans also require that each chief executive officer of each educational agency located within a public school district report information on student access to computing devices and access to the internet each year.<\/p>\n<p>NYSED additions to section 100.1 of the Commissioner\u2019s regulations define the term \u201cremote instruction.\u201d This definition identifies various ways in which remote instruction may be delivered, but which must include, in all situations, regular and substantive teacher-student interaction with an appropriately certified teacher.<\/p>\n<p>The NYS Board Regents adopted the amendments noted above that became effective as a permanent rule on September 28, 2022.<\/p>\n<p>Sections 200.7, 200.16, and 200.20 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education were amended, and became effective September 13, 2022, and December 12, 2022, as an emergency action for the preservation of the general welfare to permit approved special education providers to provide remote instruction in the 2022-2023 school year on days they would otherwise close due to an emergency and to count such instructional days towards 14 minimum requirements and to identify the ways in which such remote instruction may be delivered. These amendments relate to remote instruction and its delivery under emergency conditions for students in approved private schools for the education of students with disabilities, state-supported schools, state-operated schools, and approved preschool special education programs. These updated regulations now provide the same flexibility for remote instruction under emergency conditions that was given to school districts. The effective date of the final rule was January 25, 2023.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>REMOTE INSTRUCTION<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Commissioner&#8217;s regulations define remote instruction as <em>\u201cinstruction provided by an appropriately certified teacher, or in the case of a charter school an otherwise qualified teacher pursuant to Education Law \u00a72854(3)(a-1), who is not in the same in-person physical location as the student(s) receiving the instruction, where there is regular and substantive daily interaction between the student and teacher.<\/em>\u201d For the purpose of this plan, remote instruction means the instruction occurring when the student and the instructor are in different locations due to the closure of one or more of the district&#8217;s school buildings due to emergency conditions as determined by the Superintendent of Schools. Emergency conditions include, but are not limited to, extraordinary adverse weather conditions, impairment of heating facilities, insufficient water supply, prolonged disruption of electrical power, shortage of fuel, destruction of a school building, shortage of transportation vehicles, or a communicable disease outbreak, and the school district would otherwise close due to such an emergency.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>UNSCHEDULED SCHOOL DELAYS AND EARLY RELEASES<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Instructional hours that a school district scheduled but did not execute, either because of a delay to the start of a school day or an early release, due to emergency conditions, may still be considered as instructional hours for State aid purposes for up to two instructional hours per session day, provided the School Superintendent certifies such to NYSED, on the prescribed NYSED form, that an extraordinary condition existed on a previously scheduled session day and that school was in session on that day (<a href=\"https:\/\/govt.westlaw.com\/nycrr\/Document\/I09a7ee65c22211dda1bb852bdc84e3be?viewType=FullText&amp;originationContext=documenttoc&amp;transitionType=CategoryPageItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)\">NYSED Part 175.5<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The Emergency Remote Instruction Plan shall identify various ways in which instruction may be delivered, including synchronous and asynchronous instruction. In all situations, remote instruction requires regular and substantive teacher-student interaction with an appropriately certified teacher.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Synchronous instruction engages students in learning in the direct presence (remote or in-person) of a teacher in real time. During remote instruction, students and teachers attend together from different locations using technology. Asynchronous instruction is self-directed learning that students engage in learning without the direct presence (remote or in-person) of a teacher. Students access class materials during different hours and from different locations. During an emergency closing, synchronous instruction is the preferred method of instruction, whereas asynchronous instruction is considered supplementary instruction.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>ENSURING ACCESSIBILITY AND AVAILABILITY (INTERNET, COMPUTERS\/DEVICES)<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The SSCSD shall survey families to find out who has a reliable high-speed internet connection. A survey conducted in 2020 identified families who live in the district that do not have access, therefore remote learning is a challenge, if not impossible, for these students. Since 2020, every student who enrolls in the district provides information on internet access and computer accessibility. When students do not have internet access, the district works with the families to develop a plan to provide instructional materials for them as well as a process for recording attendance and grading.\u00a0 The district works with the community to provide locations where internet access could be used if they are able to use these locations.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Commissioner\u2019s regulation 115.17(f) outlines the annual data collection that districts must submit to SED every year by June 30. It requires the school district to survey families regarding internet and device access at the student\u2019s place(s) of residence. The chief executive officer (School Superintendent) shall survey students and parents and persons in parental relation to such students to obtain information on student access to computing devices and access to internet connectivity.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>District procedures are followed to ensure computing devices are made available to students or other means by which students will participate in synchronous instruction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>POLICIES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The plan adheres to guidance set forth in the following Board of Education policies:\u00a0 5100 Student Attendance, 5300 District Code of Conduct, 8630 Computer Resources and Data Management, 8635 Information and Data Privacy Security, Breach and Notification Staff Use of District Technology and Student Use of District Technology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DIGITAL DEVICE AND INTERNET ACCESS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The school district provides all students in grades K-12 access to a personal computing device (i.e. iPad or Cloudbook).\u00a0 In the event of an emergency, closing provisions will be made to the greatest extent possible to ensure that all students have their device at home for instruction.<\/p>\n<p>The school district participates fully in the SED Digital Access Survey along with locally developed surveys to assess how many students have internet access at home.\u00a0 The district provides hotspots to any families that indicate a need for reliable internet to facilitate access to learning at home.<\/p>\n<p>All faculty should have an alternative general activity for students in the instance that widespread power outages or other disruptions to connectivity occur preventing synchronous connection. If students lose connectivity, then the expectation is they will complete the alternate assignment provided.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>PEDAGOGY<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All teachers in grades K-12 will use Zoom as their primary instructional platform.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Teachers in grades K-5 will use Seesaw as their communication platform with students. Students will access all apps through their CLEVER accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Teachers in grades 6-12 will use CANVAS as their communication platform.

Under the provisions of New York State Education Law and the District Emergency Remote Instruction Plan any instruction sessions provided during the closure of the school facilities are counted towards annual hour requirements for meeting 180 days required for State financial aid.<\/p>\n<p>Annual Hourly Requirements for the purpose of apportionment of State Aid (for districts receiving foundation aid) are noted below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>450 instructional hours for pupils in half-day kindergarten<\/li>\n<li>900 instructional hours for pupils in full-day kindergarten and grades one through six<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0990 instructional hours for pupils in grades seven through twelve<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The district estimates the number of instructional hours it intends to claim for State aid purposes for each day spent in remote instruction due to emergency conditions from a minimum of 1 remote instruction day due to emergency conditions, up to the full year\u2019s annual hourly requirement. A district remote instructional day is the same number of hours as an in-person instructional day. The actual hours of the instructional day are discussed throughout the year with representative leadership groups.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if the school district has two (2) remote instructional days in a school year, then it will claim an estimated total hours for State Aid purposes due to emergency conditions as follows:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Grades K-5: 6 hours, 10 minutes X 2 days = 12 hours, 20 minutes<\/li>\n<li>Grades 6-8: 6 hours, 30 minutes X 2 days = 13 hours<\/li>\n<li>Grades 9-12: 6 hours, 32 minutes X 2 days = 13 hours, 4 minutes<\/li>\n<li><strong> <\/strong>For a district-wide estimated total of 38 hours<u>,<\/u> 24 minutes<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><u>TRANSPORTATION<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When a school district is in remote session, pupil transportation must be provided to students attending religious and independent schools, charter schools or students whose individualized education program (IEP) have placed them out of district. If the change to remote instruction is due to a snow or other weather emergency, such change will likely impact transportation for students attending school outside of the district. Decisions not to transport need to be based on real-time information relevant to the safety of students, staff and vehicles. School districts and religious and independent schools, charter schools and other programs are encouraged to work together to ensure continuity of education while ensuring that transportation can be provided in a safe and efficient manner.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>REPORTING<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>IMMEDIATELY\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Whenever a school building must close to instruction due to the activation of its District-wide School Safety Plan or Building-level Emergency Response Plan, a <em>Report of School Closure<\/em> must be submitted to the Commissioner of Education by the School Superintendent, (or designee) as required under CR 155.17(f) via the NYSED Report of School Closure portal. Even when remote instruction is provided during an emergency closure, a <em>Report of School Closure<\/em> must be submitted. This also applies when instruction can be delivered in an interim location or via another instructional modality.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>When it is determined that it is safe to re-open a school building after an emergency closure, the School Superintendent must notify the Commissioner by completing a corresponding <em>Report of School Re-Opening<\/em>, via the NYSED Report of School Re-Opening portal.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>Report of School Closure<\/em> is intended to provide immediate notification to the Commissioner regarding an emergency closure. The <em>Report of School Re-Opening<\/em> notifies the Commissioner of the re-opening and also collects the actual duration of the closure, the location and modality of instruction, and detailed information that may not have been available at the time of the closure.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Reasons for building closures may include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, power outages, instances of infectious disease, extraordinary adverse weather conditions and threats of violence.
