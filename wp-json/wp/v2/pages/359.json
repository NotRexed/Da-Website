Parents\/guardians, students, and school personnel must work together to ensure the maintenance of the proper atmosphere to achieve this goal. To achieve this goal, all members of the school community and visitors must act responsibly. School personnel will use restorative (mediation, counseling, and education) and\/or punitive (detention, suspension) measures to address violations of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/about-us\/policies-and-procedures\/code-of-conduct\/\">Code of Conduct<\/a>, as appropriate under the circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Annual Notifications<\/h2>\n<h3>Child Abuse Hotline<\/h3>\n<p>If you suspect a child is being abused or maltreated (neglected), report it by calling 1-800-342-3720, a toll-free 24-hour hotline operated by the New York State Office of Children and Family Services.

Information on the Code of Conduct is shared with students at the beginning of every school year.<\/p>\n<h3>Districtwide School Safety Plan<\/h3>\n<p>Safety is an underlying theme in everything we do, and we want to remind our school community about the importance we place on student and staff safety every day at the Saratoga Springs City School District. Our <a href=\"\/about-us\/school-safety\/district-wide-safety-plan\/\">District-Wide Safety Plan<\/a> outlines the way the district addresses critical issues in an expeditious and effective manner.<\/p>\n<h3>Dignity for All Students Act<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saratogaschools.org\/about-us\/policies-and-procedures\/dignity-for-all-students-act-dasa\/\">New York State Dignity for All Students Act (DASA)<\/a>, which went into effect on July 1, 2012, places a spotlight on the issues of bullying, harassment and discrimination. These are not new concerns for school districts, students and parents. However, the scope of responsibility for schools regarding how they react to and resolve these issues has expanded significantly. As with any situation, \u201can ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>In the Saratoga Springs City School District, we continue to be proactive in educating students about the \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s\u201d of behavior. The district established a Character Education Committee to ensure a comprehensive approach to character education was occurring K-12. The committee developed three promises: \u201cBe Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Caring Citizens.\u201d These promises guide how every student and every adult should behave every day.<\/p>\n<p>DASA will require more vigilance by school personnel regarding inappropriate student-to-student and adult-to-student interactions \u2013 and this is a good thing. Still, working to prevent conflicts in the first place is the best way to maximize the use of our collective energy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/forms.office.com\/r\/74cYYZkfsC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"bullying and harassment form\">Click here to report a bullying\/harassment incident<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The New York State Dignity For All Students Act seeks to provide the state\u2019s public elementary and secondary school students with a safe and supportive environment free from discrimination, intimidation, taunting, harassment, and bullying on school property, a school bus and\/or at a school function. The act states that NO student shall be subjected to harassment or discrimination by employees or students on school property or at a school function based on their actual or perceived race, color, weight, national origin, ethnic group, religion, religious practice, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or sex.<\/p>\n<h4>What is Bullying?<\/h4>\n<p>Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior among school-aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Bullying includes actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, attacking someone physically or verbally, and excluding someone from a group on purpose.<\/p>\n<h4>What is Cyberbullying?<\/h4>\n<p>Cyberbullying is bullying or harassment that takes place through communication using electronic technology. Electronic technology includes devices and equipment such as cell phones, computers, and tablets as well as communication tools including social media sites, text messages, chat, and websites. Cyberbullying may be directed toward both students and staff members.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of cyberbullying include mean text messages or emails, rumors sent by email or posted on social networking sites, and embarrassing pictures, videos, websites, or fake profiles.<\/p>\n<h4>DASA Act Coordinators<\/h4>\n<p>Each school in the district has a coordinator who has been trained to respond to issues related to DASA.
