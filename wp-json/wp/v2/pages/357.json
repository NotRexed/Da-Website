The New York State Identification Test for English Language Learners (NYSITELL) is the assessment used by all districts in New York State to determine a student\u2019s level of English proficiency and determine eligibility for ENL services. There are five levels of English proficiency: Entering (Beginning), Emerging (Low Intermediate), Transitioning (High Intermediate), Expanding (Advanced) and Commanding (Proficient).<\/p>\n<p>Students testing at Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding Levels will receive ENL supports and services, including local and New York State testing accommodations.<\/p>\n<p>All ELLs in New York State are assessed annually to determine continued eligibility for ENL. Each year in May, ELLs take the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT). The NYSESLAT score determines the student\u2019s level of English proficiency and level of service for the following school year. When a student achieves the level of \u201cCommanding,\u201d he\/she will receive ESL monitoring and supports (including testing accommodations) for two more years before exiting the ESL program.<\/p>\n<h2>Curriculum and Program Requirements\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>Our ENL curriculum is guided by the New York State English as a Second Language Learning Standards as well as the Common Core English Language Arts Standards. The\u00a0program follows the New York State regulations and consists of two types of instructional ENL time: Stand-Alone and Integrated.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stand-Alone ENL<\/strong> is an ENL class for Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning ELLs. The students receive instruction in order to acquire English language needed for success in the core content classes. Stand-Alone ENL is typically held in the ENL classroom with the ENL teacher and ELL students. Students are not taken out of core classes to receive Stand-Alone ENL.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Integrated ENL<\/strong> is for ELLs of all levels of English proficiency (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding). Integrated ENL is provided in the ELL students\u2019 grade-level classrooms. The ENL teacher and classroom teacher co-teach during ELA or a content area class. The ENL teacher will work closely with the classroom teachers to provide language supports during classroom instruction.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Resources<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smore.com\/chuqs-rbern-for-parents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Regional Bilingual Education Resource Network (RBERN)\">Regional Bilingual Education Resource Network (RBERN)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nysed.gov\/bilingual-ed\/guide-parents-english-language-learners-and-multilingual-learners-new-york-state\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"English Language Learner and Multilingual Learner Caretaker Guide\">English Language Learner and Multilingual Learner Caretaker Guide<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nysed.gov\/bilingual-ed\/helpful-links-english-language-learner-and-multilingual-learner-parents-guardians-and\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Helpful Links for English Language Learner and Multilingual Learner Caretakers\">Helpful Links for English Language Learner and Multilingual Learner Caretakers<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.colorincolorado.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" class=\"x_ContentPasted0\" id=\"LPlnkOWALinkPreview\" data-safelink=\"true\" data-linkindex=\"0\">Color\u00edn Colorado | A bilingual site for educators and families of English language learners<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brainpop.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"BrainPOP\">BrainPOP<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ell.brainpop.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"BrainPOP ELL\">BrainPOP ELL<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.titlemax.com\/articles\/ultimate-guide-to-free-reading-and-literacy-resources\/\">Guide to Free Reading and Literacy Resources<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>English as a New Language (ENL) is a specialized instructional program for students whose first language is not English.
