A significant portion of this project is being funded by Capital Reserves ($7.5 million) and estimated state aid ($81.3 million). The remaining portion of the project ($40.8 million) will be funded by issuing debt to replace existing debt that is due to expire. A percentage of this local share will also be offset by state building aid.<\/p>\n<h3>Why does SSCSD need a capital project to complete the work?<\/h3>\n<p>A capital project provides the opportunity to use capital reserve funds and maximize state building aid.
