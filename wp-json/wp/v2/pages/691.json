These included teachers and administrators from elementary, middle and high school. We also gathered feedback from the Curriculum Council, Leadership Council, and individual staff in the areas of special education, ENL, and with our homeless liaison.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our first meeting was in December of 2021. We have met multiple times including other meeting individuals listed above.<\/li>\n<li>On December 21, 2021, the Mixed Technology Leadership Team met at BOCES to begin the process of building a Tech Plan.<\/li>\n<li>On January 13, 2022, the same team met to start the Tech Plan and create a frame for a big group to review.<\/li>\n<li>On March 3, 2022, at the Curriculum Council, we presented the plan to the group and gave location for feedback.<\/li>\n<li>On March 18, 2022, at the Leadership Council, we presented the plan to the group to obtain feedback.<\/li>\n<li>We presented the plan to the following TILT groups to obtain feedback:<\/li>\n<li>March 22, 2022 \u2013 Elementary Technology Integration Leadership Team<\/li>\n<li>March 23, 2022 \u2013 High School Technology Integration Leadership Team<\/li>\n<li>March 29, 2022 \u2013 Middle School Technology Integration Leadership Team<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Relation to the Previous Three-year Plan<\/h3>\n<p>In previous years we had a District Technology Steering Committee composed of stakeholders across the district that would meet monthly. The district currently has Technology Integration Leadership Teams at all three levels(elementary, middle, and high school.) We developed a Technology Plan Team utilizing members from all three groups. We also gathered feedback from the Curriculum Council, Leadership Council, and individual staff in the areas of special education, ENL, and homelessness.<\/p>\n<p>Committees identified that goal work was not completed from the previous plan and that new goals needed to be more integrated into curriculum. The plan has two goals (one and two) that follow up on previous plan goals one and two. All students will become Empowered Learners (previous goal one) and All Students will demonstrate and practice appropriate Digital Citizenship (previous goal two).<\/p>\n<h3>How does the district Instructional Technology Plan reflect experiences during the COVID pandemic?<\/h3>\n<p>During the Covid pandemic teachers and students were forced to teach and learn fully online. Learning environments all had to be outfitted with a Web Camera (on a laptop or device, or from a document camera). Teachers were instructed on how to use the video conferencing platform of Zoom. Teachers also had to teach from a hybrid perspective (some students at home and others in the classroom). Teachers utilized online content platforms Seesaw at the elementary level and Canvas at the secondary level to provide students with resources for learning.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to COVID, SSCSD had 10 mifi devices, during the pandemic SSCSD purchased an additional 80 mifi devices to provide to students that did not have adequate internet connectivity at their place of residence.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to COVID, SSCSD had already started a 1 to 1 distribution of devices at our middle school. During the pandemic we added devices at high school and set up classroom sets at our elementary grade levels. We also had to change the model of student device because of supply chain issues. This forced us to also repurpose older devices to different grade levels. All students had access to a device during the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>Professional Development was offered through Zoom and Webex video conference platforms. The focus was on the use of Zoom, Seesaw, Canvas and the utilization of online resources.<\/p>\n<p>Instructional videos we developed for students that could be accessed from home. These videos assisted students in using Office 365, Canvas and Seesaw. The videos also emphasized the application of Clever our single sign on system for students and staff.<\/p>\n<p>Parents were involved in learning the basics of Canvas and Seesaw (their children\u2019s Learning Management System) through online courses.<\/p>\n<h3>District 1:1 Initiatives<\/h3>\n<p>While the district is not currently fully 1:1, Grades K through 5 have access to class sets that provide a device per student. Students may request to take devices home if needed to complete schoolwork. In grades 6 through 12 students are currently provided with a device. Students receive a new device in 6th and 9th grade.<\/p>\n<h3>Professional Development Planning<\/h3>\n<p>SSCSD Professional Learning Goals:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Frequently conduct needs assessments of students and staff based on qualitative and quantitative data<\/li>\n<li>Incorporate research-based practices with a focus on increasing student success based on qualitative and quantitative data<\/li>\n<li>Support individualized goals and allow for personalized professional learning paths<\/li>\n<li>Develop and provide a robust catalog of offerings that strengthen, increase, and integrate our staff\u2019s ability to holistically support students\u2019 needs (both academically and socially-emotionally)<\/li>\n<li>Regularly conduct analysis of professional learning offerings and outcomes to determine our return on investment<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>SSCSD is fortunate to be able to offer unique and robust programs, services, and partnerships in collaboration with our surrounding community.

Class sets are available at the elementary level and one to one student devices at our middle and high school for grades 6-12. MiFi internet Hot Spots are available for any student or staff that may need access to the internet. Teaching staff utilize learning management systems to create, connect and communicate digital content for our students, as well as connect to and communicate with families.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>How technology is used by teachers to facilitate their practice:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Technology is used to teach and practice concepts in engaging It plays an integral role as it allows teachers and students to access a consistent platform to organize instruction, learning, and student work. Technology plays a crucial role in supporting ongoing learning for students. Technology allows for creativity in how materials are presented and completed. It is important that technology provides students and families with a level of clarity and consistency. Technology has increased communication between teachers to students and families by providing a digital window to the classroom.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>How technology is used by students to demonstrate understanding of skills and concepts:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technology is used extensively for students to demonstrate understanding of skills and<\/li>\n<li>All secondary courses utilize Canvas to varying degrees.

Teachers are continuing to add (and change) how they use technology in the classroom as they reflect on their practice and how to use it to best meet students where they are and promote deep understanding.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>How technology is used to provide multiple pathways to access and participate in learning:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The COVID pandemic has put a spotlight on the reliance of teachers on using technology to ensure that all students can access high quality Whether it was the hybrid schedule of 2020-21 where students were zoom-ing in from home three days a week or the current year where students are in school full time but frequently disrupted by quarantines or exposures, technology has been the key tool in our toolbox of making sure access to education is available. Teachers in the secondary level (6-12) use Canvas to post daily announcements and assignments. When students miss school, they can access class materials on Canvas using their school issued or personal device. Teachers can post videos of class notes, alternate assignments for students who miss, as well as communicate easily with students via the Canvas platform.<\/li>\n<li>Digital tools provide students with multiple pathways to participate in Having technology allows for student voice and choice in their access and understanding of the curriculum. Students can submit assignments online or on paper or choose the method of their response. Technology allows more seamless peer review and class discussions to continue even beyond the bell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Explain the strategies the district plans to implement to address the need to provide equitable learning \u201ceverywhere, all the time\u201d (National Technology Plan). Include both short and long-term solutions, such as device access, internet access, human capacity, infrastructure, partnerships, etc.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Short and long-term solutions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The urgent changes and alternate schedule implemented for the 2020-21 school year due to the COVID pandemic are examples of short-term solutions that started long-term changes. The district went from 1:1 only in grades 6-8 but transitioned quickly to providing device access to any child who needed it K-12. We are in the middle of completing the 1:1 initiative at the high school and every elementary classroom has a class set of evices. There is a novel expectation that all teachers are using a consistent learning management system for collaboration, access, and communication across the district.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Device Access:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Everyone who needs access to a device has access to a device. All students are provided with a technology device. The secondary level from grades 6 to 10 is 1:1. Grades 11 and 12 will have devices by the 23-24 school year. The elementary level has a set of devices in the classroom. Secondary students bring their devices to and from school daily and elementary students can bring the devices home as needed. All teaching staff are provided with a device for planning and instructional purposes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Internet Access:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All students and staff have access to the internet at school through various WIFI access points distributed throughout the buildings. The district provides MIFI hot spots for any student or staff member who needs internet access at home.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Human Capacity (Technology Skills):<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The technological knowledge of the teaching staff has dramatically increased over the past two years and continues to grow. The COVID pandemic has thrust into the spotlight the importance of technology to ensure that students have access to education materials regardless of their ability to be present in school. Because of this, teachers had to evolve past their comfort zone and utilize technology daily in their classrooms. As our students have returned to full-time in-person instruction, the leaps we&#8217;ve made to incorporate technology into education remain. Additionally, we also offer regular professional development opportunities for teachers to explore new option<\/p>\n<p>Student capacity for technology has also increased significantly over the previous two years and continues to build. Students are comfortable with the learning management systems as teachers relied on them heavily last year and continue to. Students are comfortable exercising their choice of response and utilizing technology to participate in activities or complete assignments they may have previously missed. The use of a learning management system has also provided students with instantaneous feedback on assignments as they progress through their learning process. The significant use of the learning management systems has also provided students with autonomy and ownership of their own learning, which was not previously possible. This continues to grow and better prepares our students for the next phase of life whether it is in higher education or not.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Due to the significant increase in device use during the school day, the infrastructure in the buildings has improved dramatically. As we continue to rely on the architecture we&#8217;ve built on a daily basis, improvements continue to be made. We continue to build out our infrastructure, through the use of future capital projects to increase the robustness of this critical tool in teaching and learning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Partnerships:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All departments in the district work together and are connected via the strand of technology. We have an excellent partnership with the transportation department, delivering access points or devices to ensure that technology is accessible to staff and students. We utilize relationships with national telecommunications companies to find ways to best leverage their resources to ensure equitable access for all of our students regardless of ability to pay or geographical location. We partner very well with our Northeast Regional Information Center and our WSHWE BOCES for support, information and training as well.<\/p>\n<p>3. Students with disabilities may be served through the use of instructional technology as well as assistive technology devices and services to ensure access to and participation in the general education curriculum. Describe how instruction using technology is differentiated to support the individual learning needs of students with disabilities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Specific technology, applications, and\/or devices that the district uses to serve students with disabilities:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The district uses a variety of technology and applications to support the learning needs of students with disabilities. This includes applications specific to meeting student needs\/skill deficits in the areas of behavior management, social-emotional learning, literacy-based assistive technology software (speech-to-text, text-to-speech, word prediction programs); as well as tools for differentiating core curriculum content, data tracking and assessment, and supplementing core curriculum through specialized programs. The district offers teachers a variety of teaching tools and platforms that allow for the differentiation of content to meet a range of student needs and integrated accessibility features for access and opportunity. Specific software to meet the needs of students who have visual impairment, hearing impairment, communication impairments, and other related disabilities are provided and implemented per individual student needs.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the technology programs and applications, students with disabilities require access to a number of assistive technology devices, including, but not limited to: I-pads, laptops, large screen I-pads\/tablets and large screen laptops, FM systems, magnifiers, communication devices, switches, low-tech visual supports (I.e. Picture Exchange Communication Systems), and interactive smartboards. Students also may have access to specialized hardware, such as large format keyboards, specialized computer mice, larger display, audio output devices, and dedicated augmentative &amp; alternative communication devices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How teachers use technology to address accessibility and to differentiate, modify, and accommodate the instruction of students with disabilities:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Students within the SSCSD present with a variety of disabilities, such as vision impairment, hearing impairment, communication delay, specific learning disabilities, Autism, and social-emotional based disabilities. Differentiation is based on individual student needs and can range from low tech interventions\/scaffolding, to integrated software and higher tech devices and access.<\/p>\n<p>Many teachers deliver their instructional materials electronically. Students access these materials using their 1:1 laptops or I-pads and can access them at home as well. Students with special needs receive differentiated support via access to specialized programs and tools that assist with reading, writing, and communication. Examples of these tools include text-to-speech, speech-to-text, audiobooks, and magnifying software.
